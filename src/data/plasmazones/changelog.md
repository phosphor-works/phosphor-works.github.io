## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Windows moved to another desktop are placed there**: dropping a window onto a different desktop from the pager or the Overview left it where it landed. On a tiling or scrolling screen it sat on top of the stack without joining it, and it stayed on the desktop it came from as far as PlasmaZones was concerned, until you left the desktop and came back. A window arriving on the desktop you are looking at now joins the stack the same way a newly opened one does. On a snapping screen it floats, which is what snapping does with any window you have not dropped into a zone yourself, unless the layout fills its zones automatically, in which case the window takes the first empty one ([#996](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/996)).
- **Scrolling windows can open at their own height**: Default width under Scrolling → New columns has always offered Window decides, which opens a column at the size the application asked for. Default height offered only the even split, a fixed pixel height and a preset. It now offers Window decides too, so a window joining a column keeps the height it asked for. As with the width, a per-window rule and a per-monitor setting still outrank it. Unless a rule pins a height, Retile then leaves a window-decided height alone rather than pulling it back to the even split ([#995](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/995)).

### Fixed

- **Tabbing a column keeps every window's height**: a column of stacked windows can have a height set on each one. Turning it into tabs used to throw all but one of them away, so turning the tabs back into a stack gave you an even split instead of the layout you had built. Which window's height the tabbed column took was decided by stack order too, so it could size itself to a window you were not looking at. The tab you have in front of you now decides the column's height, and the others keep theirs for when you switch back ([#995](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/995)).
- **Clicking the focused window brings it back into view**: scrolling the strip by hand takes the view out of the centering policy's hands, which is what lets a scrolled view stay put. Focusing a window hands it back, but a click on the window that already had focus was ignored entirely, and so was the one the compositor sends when you return to a desktop. So was a switch between two windows stacked in the same column. A window you had scrolled away from stayed off to one side no matter how many times you clicked it. All three now hand the view back, and under the two policies that only move the view when they have to, a scroll that left the window fully on screen is still left alone ([#992](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/992)).
- **The shortcut cheatsheet lists the mode you are actually using**: the sheet picked its shortcuts using the mode assigned to the screen, without checking whether that mode was switched on. A screen still assigned to snapping with snapping turned off listed the snapping keys, which do nothing, and hid the tiling and scrolling ones. With tiling turned off as well, a screen assigned to tiling showed no mode's shortcuts at all. The sheet now picks a mode that is turned on. If you have all three turned off there is nothing to list, so it says so instead of opening. An open sheet also follows the switches now, including the ones changed from System Settings, and closes when you turn the last mode off ([#993](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/993)).

## [3.4.2] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Windows opened long after login land in the strip instead of off screen**: a scrolling screen remembers where its windows sat when you logged out, and it matches a returning window to a remembered slot by application when it cannot match it exactly. That loose match had no time limit, so for the rest of the session every new window of an application that was on the strip at logout was pulled into an old slot, opening below the edge of the screen without focus. The loose match is now only used for the first minute after the remembered strip is loaded or its monitor starts scrolling, which is when a restored window actually arrives ([#991](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/991)).
- **Stepping quickly between scrolling columns no longer stutters**: PlasmaZones frees the drawing resources of a column that has been off screen for ten seconds. That happened while you were still scrolling, so moving back to a column you had just left had to rebuild it, which showed as a hitch. The cleanup now waits until the strip has been still for a few seconds ([#991](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/991)).
- **Off-screen scrolling columns stop being repositioned on every scroll step**: a column parked off screen took its position from the sliding strip, so each step of the view nudged it a few pixels and sent a fresh geometry change to the window. Parked columns now sit flush with the edge they left through, which does not move while the strip slides ([#991](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/991)).
- **Shell surfaces stop logging a warning about their backdrop**: the OSD and pop-ups logged an "Unable to assign [undefined] to QImage" warning every time they were drawn with no backdrop bound, dozens of times in a session. The backdrop is only assigned while one exists now ([#991](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/991)).

## [3.4.1] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Decoration packs have previews**: decoration packs were the only kind you had to assign to a window to see. Every card in the decoration browser now renders the pack live over a stand-in window, and opening one gives a large preview with the pack's parameters beside it and a switch between the focused and unfocused appearance. The preview runs the real thing rather than a picture of it, so what you see is what the pack does on screen. Packs that sample what is behind a window show your desktop wallpaper behind the stand-in, which is a stand-in too: on a real window those packs sample the windows underneath ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).

### Changed

- **Backdrop decoration packs start at 70% content opacity**: the eight packs that sample what is behind a window (Blur, Duotone, Frosted Glass, Glass, Mosaic, Phosphor Glass, Rain on Glass, Rippled Glass) shipped with Content opacity at 1.0, which draws the window fully opaque and leaves the blur or refraction with nothing to show through. The default is now 0.7. If you never changed that parameter your windows will look more translucent after upgrading, and setting it back to 1.0 on the pack restores the old appearance ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).
- **Rippled Glass lights its ripples from above**: the pack's directional glint was pointed down-left, so the highlights sat on the underside of each ripple rather than the top. They now catch the light from the upper left. The ripple pattern is also anchored to the window frame now instead of to the drawing canvas, so it holds still when a pack that asks for an outer margin joins or leaves the chain. Both are small but visible changes to how the pack looks ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).
- **Phosphor Glass groups its parameters**: the pack's eleven parameters were one flat list and are now sorted into Blur, Shape, Content, Tint, Glow and Gradient sections in the parameter editor ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).

### Fixed

- **Multi-pass decoration packs render all their passes**: seven of the bundled decoration packs describe a blur or refraction built from more than one drawing pass, and on the daemon's own surfaces (the OSD, the picker, the pop-ups) only the last pass ever ran. Those packs drew as a flat tint there instead of as glass. All of their passes run now ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).
- **Decoration packs react to focus again**: a decorated surface always reported itself as focused, so a pack with a different inactive appearance never showed it. Focus Fade never washed out and the border packs never reached their inactive colour ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).
- **Decoration packs that need a backdrop work outside the compositor**: a pack that samples what is behind a window had nothing to sample on the daemon's own surfaces and fell back to a flat tint. It is given the desktop wallpaper there instead, which is what makes the glass family read as glass on an OSD. On a real window the compositor still samples the actual windows underneath ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).
- **Decoration packs with an outer margin are centred in it**: a pack that asks for room around the window (a glow, a shadow, drifting motes) was given that room as a band on the bottom and right only, so the effect had roughly a third of the space it asked for above and to the left and was clipped there ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).
- **Reset is where it always is in the two shader dialogs**: the shader browser and the layout editor's shader dialog each hand-rolled their own reset as a footer button instead of using the one every other parameter editor puts in its header. Both now have it in the usual place ([#984](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/984)).
- **Backdrop decoration packs round the window's corners too**: the eight glass-family packs rounded their pane but drew the window's own picture over it with square corners, so the window showed past the rounded pane whenever Content opacity was below 1.0, and at 1.0 the Corner radius parameter did nothing. The window now takes the same rounded clip as the pane ([#988](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/988)).
- **Phosphor Vortex stays under the cursor while you drag**: the one animation pack that centres itself on the cursor treated the pointer leaving the window as the end of a hover and snapped its swirl to the window's centre. That happens routinely mid-drag, since the dragged window stops at the top of the screen while the pointer keeps going. During a held drag the swirl now tracks the pointer, sliding along the window edge the pointer left through instead of jumping away ([#986](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/986)).
- **Panel space is charged to the panel that reserves it**: with the fallback screen-geometry path in use, the space panels reserve was split across every edge that has a panel, whether or not that panel reserves any. A hidden auto-hide dock opposite a normal panel stole part of the reservation, so zones sat under one panel and left a gap at the other edge. When the panels' own sizes account for the reserved total, it now goes to the edges that actually reserve it ([#985](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/985), [#987](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/987)).
- **Zones hold still while Plasma's floating panels dock and undock**: dragging a window near a floating panel makes stock Plasma dock the panel, which moves the work area, and PlasmaZones responded by recomputing every zone and retiling mid-drag, so zones shifted after you had aimed at them. The recompute now waits until the drag ends and the panels have settled ([#987](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/987)).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Scrolling mode**: a third placement mode alongside Snapping and Tiling, modeled on the niri compositor. Windows form columns on an endless strip and the screen is a window onto it, so opening a new window never resizes the ones you have. The strip slides them aside and scrolls the view instead. Columns cycle through width presets or take any width. Windows in a column share it between them or show one at a time as tabs with a compact indicator alongside the column, and a window can be consumed into a neighboring column or expelled into its own. A column can be centered on demand or follow one of niri's focus centering policies. Scrolling is assigned per screen, desktop, and activity from the Monitors page, and the mode toggle shortcut cycles through all three modes. It has its own settings section beside Snapping and Tiling, with an enable switch and a shortcut family on Meta+Alt. Rule actions cover per-app and per-context behavior. Windows too large for the strip float instead, using the existing floating support, and a minimized window returns to the slot it left ([#852](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/852)).
- **Scrolling templates**: scrolling screens get their own template objects, the peer of snapping's layouts and tiling's algorithms. A template describes how a scrolling screen behaves: the starting columns the first windows form (width and stacked or tabbed display for each), the width the columns after them open at, and the width and height presets the cycling shortcuts step through. Templates are managed on the Scrolling → Templates page and edited in the layout editor, and three starters ship bundled (Thirds, Sixty forty, Tabbed halves). Editing a bundled template stores your own copy, and deleting the copy brings the built-in one back. Templates carry the full management surface the other families have: import and export as JSON, duplicate, a context menu with set-as-default and open-in-text-editor, source and name filters, and a Scrolling → Quick Shortcuts page binding templates to the quick digits. Assign a template per screen with the layout picker, the Monitors page dropdown, the quick layout digits, or the layout cycle shortcuts, following the same per-screen, per-desktop, and per-activity assignment the other modes use, or make a template the default from its card's context menu, which covers screens without their own. A screen can also be set to use no template at all, in which case it walks the width and height steps on Settings → Scrolling → Columns. A rule action, Set scrolling template, applies one per context. Applying a template mainly shapes the columns that open afterwards. The columns you already have keep the widths you gave them, apart from a column sized from a width preset, which reflows to the nearest width the new template offers ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887), [#929](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/929)).
- **The scrolling strip can run top to bottom**: a strip is no longer always side to side. On a screen running top to bottom the columns become full-width rows stacked down the screen, and every verb, shortcut and animation keeps its meaning along the new axis. Parking, tabs, the drop indicator, the drag popup's row of cards and the strip shaders all turn with it, and the layout editor draws a template the way the target screen will lay it out. A new Strip direction card under Settings → Scrolling → Window chooses the axis, and its monitor scope chip sets a different direction per monitor, so a portrait side monitor can run top to bottom while the main screen stays side to side. A Set strip direction rule action layers over both, per screen, desktop, or activity. Match the screen shape is the default and runs the strip top to bottom on a monitor taller than it is wide, so a portrait screen switches over without being asked, while Side to side and Top to bottom pin it. A square work area resolves to side to side, and so does a work area the gaps have collapsed to nothing. The directional scrolling shortcuts keep their ids and their chords, so nothing you have bound moves, but their names now say what they do on either axis: the Focus Column Left and Focus Column Right pairs (each with a Stopping at the Edge and a Wrapping variant) became Focus Previous Column and Focus Next Column with the same variants, Focus Top Window in Column and Focus Bottom Window in Column became Focus First Window in Column and Focus Last Window in Column, and the consume-or-expel pair now reads toward the start and toward the end of the strip. The daemon and the KWin effect exchange the axis, so both must be rebuilt and installed from the same source ([#923](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/923)).
- **Crop columns at the screen edge**: a scrolling column that is only partly on screen is resized to fit the space it has, so nothing overhangs onto a neighbouring monitor and a column with too little room slides away instead of leaving a sliver. A new Crop columns at the screen edge switch under Settings → Scrolling → Window keeps the full-size look instead by cutting the drawing at the edge, at the price of some efficiency in fullscreen video and games while any screen uses scrolling ([#885](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/885)).
- **Meta+wheel scrolls through columns**: on a screen in Scrolling mode, holding Meta and scrolling the mouse wheel focuses the next column and slides the strip, matching niri's Mod+wheel navigation. Horizontal wheel ticks and two-finger horizontal touchpad scrolls work too. The gesture has its own switch under Settings → Scrolling → Window, on by default, with an option to invert the direction. The wheel binding is claimed only while the switch is on and at least one screen uses Scrolling mode, and it is released back to the compositor otherwise ([#852](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/852)).
- **Scroll the strip without moving focus**: the strip only ever moved as a side effect of something else, so looking at a column further along meant focusing it first. Hold Meta+Shift and scroll the wheel to move the view along the strip one step per notch while focus stays on the window you were working in. It mirrors Meta+wheel, which moves focus one column per notch, and it shares that gesture's on/off switch and its invert option. Both chords are yours to set. A new View scroll step slider under Scrolling → Window sets how far a notch goes as a share of the work area. For the keyboard, Meta+Alt+Y and Meta+Alt+Shift+Y scroll a whole work area at a time. The view stays where you scrolled it until you move the focus or use one of the centering shortcuts, so on a screen set to always center the focused column the strip no longer springs back the moment you let go. The tab indicators and the strip's own animation follow the scroll the same way they follow everything else.
- **The scroll strip slides as one piece**: focusing another column used to move every window on screen separately, so a fast scroll could visibly shear as the columns drifted apart, and a column leaving the view blinked out instead of travelling off the edge. The strip is now a single object with one animation per screen, and the columns hold their spacing for the whole slide. Windows still animate on their own for real changes, so a column that also changed width keeps its own motion on top of the slide. The motion has its own entry under Settings → Animations → Motion → Scrolling, shown when the advanced settings are on, where the curve, the duration and a shader can be set like any other ([#890](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/890), [#891](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/891)).
- **More scrolling verbs from niri**: Center Visible Columns (`Meta+Alt+Shift+C`) centers the group of fully visible columns as a block, the whole-span companion of Center Column. Focus First Window in Column and Focus Last Window in Column (`Meta+Alt+V` and `Meta+Alt+Shift+V`) jump to the ends of the focused column. Switch Focus Between Floating and Placed Windows (`Meta+Alt+X`) moves focus between the floating windows and the tiled columns, and it now covers every mode, described in its own entry below. Move Window to Floating and Move Window to Tiled ship unbound, the same configuration-file binding as the focus variants above, and give the float toggle a deterministic one-way form ([#897](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/897)).
- **Equalize Column Widths and Minimize Column Width**: two more ways to re-flow the strip from the keyboard. Equalize Column Widths on Meta+Ctrl+Shift+T gives every column fully on screen an equal share of the screen and leaves any column clipped at an edge alone. A column that cannot shrink to its share keeps its smallest size and the others share what is left, and the group lines up with the edge of the screen afterwards and stays there until you move the focus or use one of the centering shortcuts. Minimize Column Width on Meta+Alt+Shift+E shrinks the focused column to the smallest size preset. Both sit on the Shift twin of the verb they pair with, Retile Windows and Grow Column into Empty Space.
- **Retile Windows works on scrolling screens**: the Retile Windows shortcut did nothing on a screen in scrolling mode. It now puts every column back to the screen's default width and display and every window back to an even share of its column, so one key re-applies the layout whichever engine the screen is on. On a screen where windows keep their own width, the shortcut leaves the widths as they are and only resets the column display and the window heights, unless a rule sets a width for that screen. Its cheatsheet row moves from Autotile to General and describes what it does on the screen you opened the sheet from.
- **Windowed fullscreen for the scroll strip**: `Meta+Alt+Shift+F` tells the focused window it is fullscreen while it keeps its place in its column, matching niri's toggle-windowed-fullscreen. The application switches to its fullscreen presentation, so a video player hides its controls and a game picks its fullscreen mode, but the window stays its column's size and the strip keeps scrolling around it. Pressing the shortcut again, or leaving fullscreen from inside the application, returns the window to its normal presentation in the same slot. Floating the window ends it too, and so does minimizing it, because a window that leaves the strip is no longer a column tile. The window comes back at its normal size. The state survives a daemon restart with the rest of the strip. After a full logout the window returns to its column without the fullscreen presentation. While a window is in windowed fullscreen it cannot be dragged or resized with the mouse, because the compositor treats a fullscreen window as pinned. The keyboard verbs for width, height, and movement all keep working ([#895](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/895)).
- **Open rules from niri for scrolling windows**: three new window rule actions cover how a matched window arrives on a scrolling screen. Open maximized starts its column at the full work-area width. Focus when opened decides per window whether it takes focus as it opens, layering over the global focus-new-windows setting in both directions, so a background tool can open quietly while the global setting stays on, or a terminal can take focus while it is off. Open in fullscreen puts the window into real fullscreen as it appears, and its off position blocks an application's own fullscreen request at open, which tames apps that insist on starting fullscreen. The existing open rules for width, height, tabbed display, and column placement gain these as siblings in the same Window / Scrolling picker group ([#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **Focus crosses monitors on a scrolling screen**: moving focus past the last column used to stop dead at the strip edge, even though moving a window there crossed onto the next monitor and the tiling mode's focus already crossed as well. The plain focus shortcuts now continue onto the neighboring monitor, entering its strip at the window facing the edge you crossed, and the crossing also works when the neighbor runs Snapping or Tiling mode. The reverse direction works too, so a focus press on a Tiling screen crosses into a Scrolling or Snapping neighbor the same way. Crossing works vertically too, for stacked monitor arrangements: a focus or move past the top or bottom of a column continues onto the monitor above or below, and a directional focus press on an empty scrolling monitor walks straight onto the neighbor instead of doing nothing. For users who prefer niri's exact stop-at-the-edge behavior, edge-stop variants of the column focus shortcuts (Focus Previous Column and Focus Next Column, Stopping at the Edge) ship unbound, alongside wrap variants (Focus Previous Column and Focus Next Column, Wrapping) that jump to the far end of the strip instead. An unbound action stays out of the system Shortcuts app until it has a chord, so give one a chord by setting its Shortcuts.Scrolling key in the PlasmaZones configuration file, and the daemon binds it live ([#897](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/897)).
- **Floating and placed focus switch in every mode**: Switch Focus Between Floating and Placed Windows (`Meta+Alt+X`) now works on Snapping and Tiling screens as well as Scrolling. One press jumps from the layout to the floating window you last used, and the next press jumps back to the window the layout had focused, so a floating terminal or player is always one key away from the tiled work behind it. Each mode remembers its own most recent window on each side, a minimized window is never chosen, and when the remembered window is gone another window on that side answers instead. The shortcut now sits in the General group of the cheatsheet. A chord you set yourself keeps working because the system stores it under the shortcut's unchanged name. The old Shortcuts.Scrolling configuration key is no longer read, so if you keep the chord in the configuration file, write it under Shortcuts.Global from now on ([#910](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/910)).
- **Drag a window back into the scroll strip**: dragging a window while a screen is in Scrolling mode now re-inserts it where you drop it, the same way dragging works in Snapping and Tiling. The window leaves the strip when the drag starts, so the columns behind it stay still while you aim, and the new position is applied on drop. Dropping between two columns opens a column of its own, dropping onto a column joins it at the row you are over, and pressing Escape puts the window back exactly where it came from. It uses the same trigger settings as the other modes, so you can require a modifier or a mouse button, or leave it always on ([#873](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/873)).
- **The scroll strip scrolls while you drag**: dragging a window towards either edge of the working area on a scrolling screen now scrolls the strip, so you can drop it on a column that was off screen when the drag started. Previously the only columns you could reach were the ones already visible. The strip starts moving after the pointer has been near the edge for a moment, and it moves faster the closer to the edge you hold it. While it scrolls, the drop target stays put at the edge as a new column, so the columns slide past a target that does not move around under your pointer. Pull back towards the middle and the usual per-column targeting takes over again, now aimed at the columns the scroll brought into view. It has its own section under Settings → Scrolling → Window with a switch, the width of the band at the edge that starts it, how long the pointer has to sit there first, and the top speed ([#922](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/922)).
- **Drop indicator for the scroll strip**: while a drag re-insert is in progress, the exact space the window will land in is highlighted, so the drop is no longer a guess. It has its own section under Settings → Scrolling → Window with a switch, a fill color, a fill opacity, a border color, a border width, and a corner radius. The two colors follow your color scheme until you pick one, the color picker offers the alpha channel, and the border honors a translucent pick the way the snapping overlay's border does while the fill keeps the Fill opacity slider as its one transparency control. The defaults match the snapping zone overlay so the two highlights look like the same thing ([#873](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/873), [#899](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/899)).
- **Drop indicator rule actions**: the drop indicator is now configurable per context and per app, the way the tab indicator already was. Six actions cover the whole card, so a rule can turn the indicator off, recolor its fill and border, or change its opacity, border width and corner radius for one screen, desktop or activity. Two more act on the window you are dragging, recoloring the indicator's fill and border while that app is in hand, which is useful when you want a particular application's drops to stand out. A per-window color wins over a per-context one, which wins over the setting, which follows your color scheme ([#873](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/873)).
- **The drag popup shows the scroll strip**: dragging a window to a screen edge on a scrolling screen now opens a strip-mode popup, the scrolling counterpart of the snapping zone selector. Instead of zone layouts it renders the strip itself, one card per column with the tiles stacked inside (or a tab strip for a tabbed column). Dropping on the leading half of a card prepends the window to that column and the trailing half appends it, which reads as the top and bottom halves on a side-to-side strip and as the left and right halves on a top-to-bottom one. A gap between cards, or a band just past either end of the strip, opens a new column there, and a tabbed card takes the window as a new tab. An empty strip offers a single drop target that starts the first column. The popup is an aim surface layered over the existing in-strip drop targets, so dropping directly on the strip keeps working as before, and while the popup holds a pick the in-strip indicator paints the slot the popup is offering. The popup has its own Strip Selector page under Settings → Scrolling with an enable switch, a picker for where the popup appears, a trigger distance, and the preview size. The position and trigger distance share a per-monitor scope chip and the preview size has its own, so both cards can be overridden per monitor from the page. On D-Bus, org.plasmazones.Settings gains a scrollingZoneSelector per-screen category for the same overrides. A new Show the drag selector rule action layers over whichever selector switch a screen uses, in both directions, so a rule can keep either popup off a recording monitor or offer it there while its global switch is off. A window matched by an Exclude or Exclude from placement rule is no longer offered either drag popup, because its drop would be refused on release ([#915](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/915)).
- **Scrolling shortcuts follow one resize convention, and the cheatsheet explains them**: the adjust pairs sit on mnemonic letters with the opposed action on Shift plus the same letter, and the preset cycles page on the paging keys. Consume Window into Column is `Meta+Alt+I` with Expel Window from Column on `Meta+Alt+Shift+I`, Increase Column Width is `Meta+Alt+W` with Decrease Column Width on `Meta+Alt+Shift+W`, and Increase Window Height is `Meta+Alt+H` with Decrease Window Height on `Meta+Alt+Shift+H`. Cycle Column Width Preset is `Meta+Alt+PgUp` with Cycle Column Width Preset Back on `Meta+Alt+PgDown`, and Cycle Window Height Preset is `Meta+Alt+Shift+PgUp` with Cycle Window Height Preset Back on `Meta+Alt+Shift+PgDown`. Reset Window Heights is `Meta+Ctrl+Alt+T`, joining Retile Windows' `Meta+Ctrl+T` and Equalize Column Widths' `Meta+Ctrl+Shift+T` on the one letter for re-flowing the strip, instead of sitting on `Meta+Alt+0` where it read as a tenth layout digit. Every default sits on a key that exists unshifted on any keyboard layout, so no chord is dead on non-US layouts. The action once called "Expand Column to Available Width" is named "Grow Column into Empty Space" to tell it apart from Maximize Column, because it claims the empty space visible on screen for the focused column and leaves every other column alone. Hovering a row in the shortcut cheatsheet's Scrolling group shows a plain-language description of what the action does, so consume, expel, and the column sizing verbs no longer require guessing ([#874](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/874)).
- **The width and height preset steps are editable**: the cycling shortcuts walk a list of width steps and a list of height steps, and on a screen with no layout template those lists come from Settings → Scrolling → Columns. A Width and height presets card below the New columns card edits them. It matters more now that a screen can be set to use no template at all, because that screen walks these steps and nothing else. A screen using a template still walks the template's own lists, and each list is replaced whole, so a template carrying widths but no heights leaves the heights here in play. The card opens on the first percentage the list does not already hold, so it never opens on a value that collides with a step you already have. After that the box keeps whatever you set it to, and Add greys out while it sits on a percentage a card already carries, which one arrow press clears ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887), [#929](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/929), [#976](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/976)).
- **The two wheel scroll keys are yours to set**: holding Meta to move column focus and Meta+Shift to pan the view were fixed bindings with no way to change them. Both are now trigger lists under Settings → Scrolling → Window, in the Focus and view card, so you can move them off Meta if it clashes with something else you use. They stay the defaults, and turning the feature off still hands both chords back to the compositor. A chord over a screen that is not running the strip now scrolls the application underneath instead of being swallowed.
- **Focus follows mouse can stop short of a long scroll**: on a scrolling screen, moving the pointer onto a column that is partly off screen scrolls the whole strip to bring it in, so brushing past the edge of the screen can carry the view somewhere you never meant to go. A new Limit how far the strip scrolls slider sits under the Focus follows mouse switch, on Settings → Scrolling → Window. At or below the limit the pointer focuses the column as before, and past it the pointer is ignored and focus stays where it is. The limit is a share of the work area along the strip, so it reads the same on any monitor and in either strip direction, and it starts at 100%, which never ignores anything. A Limit how far the strip scrolls rule action sets it per screen, desktop, or activity ([#977](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/977)).
- **Per-window scroll speed**: a Set scroll speed rule multiplies mouse wheel and touchpad scrolling inside matching windows, niri's scroll-factor. Values below 1 slow a window whose own scrolling feels too fast and values above 1 speed up a sluggish one. Everything else on screen keeps its normal speed ([#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **Every scrolling behavior is a rule now**: the seven scrolling toggles that were app-wide settings gain per-context rule actions, so each can differ per monitor, desktop, or activity. Center a lone column, Respect minimum window sizes, Crop columns at the screen edge, Focus new windows, Smart gaps, and Focus follows the mouse are switches. Set sticky window handling picks how windows shown on all desktops are treated. A wide monitor can center its lone column while a portrait one does not, or focus-follows-mouse can be on for the scrolling screen and off everywhere else. Each falls back to its global setting where no rule matches, and a per-window Focus when opened rule still wins over the per-context one ([#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **Absolute column width and window height over D-Bus**: four typed methods on org.plasmazones.Scrolling set the focused column's width or the focused window's height by value, the counterpart of niri's set-column-width and set-window-height for scripting. The width takes an exact fraction or pixel value. The height fraction is stored as a preset anchor that snaps to the nearest entry of the screen's height presets, and setWindowHeightPixels is the exact height form. Shortcuts carry no value argument, so this surface is where the absolute forms live ([#897](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/897)).
- **Tab indicator settings**: the indicator over a tabbed scrolling column is now fully configurable, matching niri's `tab-indicator` options. You can pick its position on any of the column's four edges, its thickness, how much of the edge it spans, the gap between it and the window, the gap between individual tabs, and the corner radius. A negative gap draws the indicator over the window rather than beside it. It can hide itself when a tabbed column holds only one window, and it can reserve space inside the column so it never overlaps a neighbor or runs off screen. Every default matches niri's, so out of the box you get a thin bar of colored segments down the column's left edge. A second style draws titled chips instead, naming each window, which suits a top or bottom edge. The active, inactive, and urgent tab colors follow your color scheme unless you set them. Clicking a tab switches to its window, and clicks anywhere else reach the windows beneath. Every option is available as a per-context rule action, and a window rule can recolor one application's own tab ([#871](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/871)).
- **Tab switches cross-fade**: switching tabs in a scrolling column now blends the tab you left into the one you picked, in place, over the same rectangle. Both tabs are ordinary windows at the same size and position, so the column reads as one surface changing its contents. The transition has its own entry, Tab Switched, under Settings → Animations → Motion → Scrolling, where the curve, the duration, and the shader can be set like any other. There is no default, so a tab switch stays an instant cut until you pick a pack. Only tab shaders fit the event, because a tab shader reads the outgoing tab as well as the arriving one. Six generic packs ship, and the Phosphor pair below makes eight. Tab Fade blends the two in place. Tab Slide pushes one out of the column as the other follows it in. Tab Wipe sweeps the new tab across the old with an edge you can soften or sharpen. Tab Dissolve grains one into the other. Tab Flip turns the column over like a card. Tab Zoom pulls the old tab toward you as the new one rises from behind it. In earlier 3.4 development builds the arriving tab also flew up from below the screen, because the hidden tabs are parked there and nothing said the activation was a swap rather than a journey. The two now trade places without moving, which is what the switch actually is ([#908](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/908)).
- **Tab labels can use a font of your own**: the labels on tab chips had no font of their own and followed the zone label font from Snapping → Overlay → Appearance, so changing one changed the other. Scrolling → Tabs, shown when the advanced settings are on, now has a Font row on the Tab indicator card where you pick the typeface, weight, italic, underline and strikeout for tab labels alone, with a reset button that puts it back to the system font in bold ([#938](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/938)).
- **The strip preview shows which columns are tabbed**: a scrolling screen's live preview drew a column holding five tabbed windows exactly like one holding a single window, because the strip lists only the tab on show. Tabbed columns now carry a row of pills along the edge their real tab indicator uses, one pill per tab, with the tab on show lit. The pills follow the indicator's position and how far it reaches, while their thickness is set for legibility instead of scaled down, which at thumbnail size would put it under a single pixel. The preview on the Monitors page and the one in the mode-change OSD both draw them ([#948](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/948)).
- **Urgent windows are tracked**: PlasmaZones now follows the compositor's attention-demanding state for every window, so a tab whose window is asking for attention stands out in the tab indicator even while another tab is showing ([#871](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/871)).
- **Scrolling templates open in the layout editor**: editing a template now happens in the layout editor as its own mode, replacing the form dialog the settings app carried. The editor shows the starting columns as a strip of bands, the way the first windows will actually lay out, and the canvas turns with the strip direction of the screen being edited, so a top-to-bottom screen's template is authored as rows stacked down the canvas. Drag the edge after a column to resize it, click a column to select it, and use its buttons to reorder it, switch it between stacked and tabbed, or remove it. A red line marks where the screen ends, so you can see which starting columns open off screen. The panel beside the strip holds the description, the width the later columns open at, and the width and height presets, and every change is undoable with the usual shortcuts. New Template and every Edit action on the Templates page open the editor this way, and the editor gains matching command-line flags along with an openEditorForScrollingTemplate method on the public org.plasmazones.LayoutRegistry interface for scripts. The launch methods on that interface now answer whether the editor process actually started, and the settings app shows a notice when it did not ([#918](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/918)).
- **Scrolling templates take a priority order**: a new Priority page under Scrolling → Configuration sets the order templates appear in when cycling with the keyboard shortcuts and in the layout picker, the same drag-to-reorder page that snapping layouts and tiling algorithms already have. The scrolling pages gain a Configuration section holding it beside the Quick Shortcuts page, the template library can sort by the priority order, and the priority rows and dropdown previews now render their zones highlighted so each row is readable without hovering it ([#926](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/926)).
- **The layout picker offers "no template"**: on a scrolling screen the picker popup listed only real templates, so once you picked one there was no way to take it back from the popup. It now carries a None card alongside them, which sets the screen to use no template at all. The card appears wherever the picker offers templates, including on a screen that has none to choose between, because a screen inheriting a default still has to be able to opt out of it. A screen already set that way opens the picker with the None card highlighted, and the popup opens scrolled to whichever card is highlighted. The cards scroll when there are more of them than fit on the screen, so a long list no longer runs off the top and bottom with no way to reach what was cut ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887), [#929](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/929)).
- **Pick a scrolling screen's template on the Monitors page, including none at all**: a scrolling screen showed a strip preview and an explanation where the other two modes each offer a selector, so the template governing it could only be changed from the layout picker popup. It now has its own dropdown beside them, listing every template plus a None entry the other families do not need. Default follows the default template from Scrolling → Templates, as it does for the other two families, and None means this screen uses no template at all, so its columns keep the built-in width and height steps even while a default is set. None is a new state. Before it, a screen with no template of its own always inherited whatever default was set, with no way to opt out. The pick is applied with the rest of the page, so Discard reverts it ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887), [#929](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/929)).
- **A scrolling screen says which template it uses**: the Monitors page used to label a scrolling screen's preview with the bare mode name and tell you it uses no zone layout, which left the template that actually shapes the strip invisible. The preview now carries the template's name, and the note below it says what that template governs. A screen with no template of its own says so and points at the default template setting. When the template defines starting columns, the note also tracks how many are in use, so it is visible that a starting column is spent once a column has taken it and that later columns open at the template's ordinary width and display. The count is live and follows the strip. The two settings under Settings → Scrolling → Columns that a template overrides, Default width and Open new columns as, now say so on the row, because a screen with a template takes both from the template and the setting looked broken ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887)).
- **Rules can target a specific template**: on a scrolling screen the Active layout rule field carries the template in use, the same way it carries the algorithm on a tiling screen, so a rule can set gaps, the overlay, or the lock for the screen showing a given template. The rule editor's Active layout picker offers a Template entry per template. A rule matching the bare scrolling value means a scrolling screen with no template. Match the Mode field to address every scrolling screen ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887)).
- **Shaders for the scrolling strip**: the Strip Scrolled entry now takes a shader, so the strip's motion can be decorated as it happens. A strip shader runs once per screen over the scrolling scene while the slide is in flight, driven by how far and how fast the strip is moving, and it stops on its own the moment the strip settles. Anything sitting above the strip, like a notification or an on-screen display, is drawn sharp on top and is never touched by it. Five packs ship: Strip Motion Blur smears along the direction of travel, Strip Chromatic pulls the color channels apart, Strip Jelly bows the rows like a soft body, Strip Carousel tilts the strip like a spinning drum, and Phosphor Gate lights the two screen edges as columns enter and leave, in the Phosphor style. There is no default, so scrolling stays a plain slide until you pick one ([#891](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/891)).
- **Snapping and Tiling screens can use no layout at all**: the None state scrolling screens gained for templates now exists for the other two modes. The layout picker popup carries a None card on every screen, and picking it opts that screen out of layouts entirely. On a Snapping screen that means no zones, so windows float freely and dragging to the edges snaps to nothing. On a Tiling screen the mode stays selected but nothing tiles, so windows open where they please. The Monitors page selectors gain a matching None entry beside Default, where Default keeps inheriting the configured default layout or algorithm and None refuses it, which is the new part. Before this, a screen with no pick of its own always inherited the default, with no way to opt out. The Set snapping layout and Set tiling algorithm rule actions offer None too, so a rule can hold a projector or recording monitor layout-free. Deleting a layout a Snapping screen was using now leaves that screen with no layout instead of silently handing it the default, matching what deleting a scrolling screen's template already did. A screen set to None opens the picker with the None card highlighted, and picking any real layout or algorithm takes it back off the opt-out. The default itself can be cleared the same way. Right-clicking the current default layout or algorithm in the library now offers Clear Default, matching what templates already had. With the default cleared, a snapping screen with no pick of its own shows no zones and a tiling screen tiles nothing, instead of falling back to the first layout or the stock algorithm, and Set as Default on any card brings a default back ([#934](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/934)).
- **Snap to zone rules can name the zone**: the Snap to zone rule action used to take zone numbers only, so a rule that sent an app to zone 1 held only for the layout where that app's zone happened to be first. The action now carries a Zone names field beside the numbers. A name is looked up in whichever layout is active on the screen the window is placed on (the monitor a Route to screen action in the same rule sends it to, otherwise the one it opens on), matched without regard to case, so naming the zones Editor, Browser and Terminal across your layouts lets one rule place an app correctly in all of them. Names and numbers can be mixed, and the window spans their combined area. A name the active layout does not have is skipped, and when two zones share a name the lowest-numbered one wins. The field offers the names your layouts already use from a picker next to it, and the rule list shows names in quotes so a numeric-looking name is not mistaken for a number ([#924](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/924), [#932](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/932)).
- **Unfloat fallback as a per-window rule**: the snapping setting that places an unfloated window into a zone when it has no remembered one can now be overridden per window with a Fall back to a zone on unfloat rule. A fresh rule opts the matched window in over the global default, and its off position keeps a window floating even with the global setting on ([#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **Keep floating windows above the placed ones, per mode**: a floated window used to stack wherever KWin put it, so clicking a tile could bury the window you had just floated over it. Each mode's Window handling card gains a Keep floating windows above switch, under Snapping, Tiling and Scrolling, that keeps the windows you float in that mode stacked above the windows it places. Unfloating the window, or turning the switch off, puts its own keep-above state back the way it was. Switching a screen between Snapping and Tiling applies the new mode's switch to that screen's floating windows straight away, so a window kept above under one mode does not stay there once the other mode takes over. A rule that sets a window layer wins over the switch for the windows it matches, so the existing per-context way of doing this keeps working unchanged ([#962](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/962)).
- **Scoped exclusion rule actions**: two new rule actions split the blanket Exclude. "Exclude from placement" keeps an application's windows out of tiling, snapping, and scrolling while its borders, decoration packs, and animations still apply, which suits tools like deskflow that should stay floating but keep their styling. "Exclude from decorations" turns off only PlasmaZones' own window styling and leaves placement and animations alone. The existing Exclude action keeps its full meaning, and the "Exclude an app from placement" quick-start template now uses the placement-only action. Rules already created from the old template keep their stored blanket behavior ([#880](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/880)).
- **On-screen displays can be ruled off per monitor**: a new Show on-screen displays context action suppresses the layout and navigation popups for a matched screen, desktop, or activity, which keeps them off a projector or a recording monitor while the other screens keep theirs. Its on position works the other way, showing the popups for that context even while the global OSD toggles are off. The None display style still hides everything ([#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **Every rule action explains itself**: the rule editor's action rows now carry the same hover info icon the condition fields have, with a one-line description of what the selected action does. The descriptions spell out the couplings that used to be invisible, most importantly that Set opacity, Set tint strength, and Set tint color only take effect while the opacity and tint layer is on for the window ([#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **Rules can match the system color scheme**: a new Color scheme rule field matches whether the desktop is using a light or dark theme, so a rule can pick different gaps, overlay colors, or a different layout for day and night themes. The daemon watches the application palette, so when the scheme flips it re-resolves the per-screen assignments and refreshes the overlay and lock surfaces with no restart. Daemon resolved window actions pick the new verdict up on the window's next event. The field pairs with the context actions and the daemon resolved window actions. The compositor consumed actions (borders, opacity, animations) do not see it ([#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **Appearance and animation rules see the active layout too**: window rules that set borders, opacity, decorations, window layer, animations, or the snap and animation exclusions can now match the Active layout field, including a scrolling screen's template. Before this, only the per-context rules (gaps, overlay, lock, layout selection) could tell layouts apart, and a window rule on the field silently never matched ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887)).
- **A release grace period for drag triggers**: when the activation trigger is a mouse button held while dragging with the other one, the two buttons rarely let go on the same frame. If the trigger button lifted first, the zone overlay cleared before the drop arrived and the window floated where it was released instead of snapping. Each placement mode's Triggers card now has a Release grace period, 150 ms by default, during which the overlay or the re-insert preview stays active after the trigger is released, so a drop just after letting go still lands where it was aimed. The same applies to the stack preview on tiling screens, the strip preview on scrolling screens, and the zone span modifier, which has its own grace on the Zone span card. It only applies while holding to activate, since toggle mode has no release to extend, and setting it to 0 turns it off. Snap assist has one too, on the Snapping → Window page, and it matters most there. The picker is decided at the instant you let go of the window, which is exactly when a trigger held by the same hand has usually lifted already. Simple mode carries the snapping one so you do not have to open the advanced page to reach it. This is how FancyZones feels with its right mouse button activation ([#963](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/963)).
- **Rendering device selector**: a new picker under Settings → General → Rendering chooses which GPU draws the zone overlays, popups, and on-screen displays on machines with more than one graphics device. Automatic keeps the driver's own choice. The selection applies to the PlasmaZones daemon and the layout editor after a daemon restart, and window contents are unaffected because KWin composites those ([#883](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/883)).
- **A global blur quality setting for decoration packs**: a new Blur card on Settings → Appearance → Decorations → General picks Low, Balanced, or High quality for the base blur every glass-family decoration pack builds on. The setting scales the resolution each pack computes its blur at, relative to what the pack chooses for itself, so Low is cheaper on the graphics card and a little softer in motion while High is sharper and costs more. On integrated graphics this is the main per-frame cost lever for glass packs, where the existing Performance card only bounds when the packs animate ([#927](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/927)).
- **Decoration packs can style the Plasma shell**: the decoration pass used to reject every surface belonging to the Plasma shell, so a pack could never reach the panel or the launcher. Panels and applet popups are now decoration surfaces of their own, each with its own pack chain, under a new Shell page beside Windows, OSDs and Popups. Applet popups cover the application launcher, the system tray flyouts, and any widget's expanded view. Engaging a chain for these surfaces is the whole opt-in, whether you build it on the Shell page or apply a decoration set that carries one. These surfaces never take the global default decoration, so they stay untouched until you build a chain for them, and there is no separate enable switch to remember. They also take neither the plain border and opacity settings nor the decoration exclusion rules, because those are written about application windows, so a pack chain is the whole decoration. Shell surfaces always render a pack's focused appearance and keep animating with the Animate only the active window switch on, because a panel is never the active window. All panels on a screen share one setting, because the compositor reports them identically and there is nothing to tell one from the other. A panel is on screen all the time, so expect it to cost more than an applet popup, which is only drawn while it is open ([#925](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/925)).
- **The Plasma shell's popups can animate**: the animation pass rejected every surface the Plasma shell owns, so the application launcher and the system tray flyouts appeared and vanished with whatever KWin does for them and nothing more. A new Shell page under Animations → Transitions gives applet popups their own Shown and Hidden events, which cover the launcher, the tray flyouts and any widget's expanded view. Pick a shader on All Shell Surfaces and the popup plays it as it opens and replays it in reverse as it closes, the same way a window's own open and close events work, or set Shown and Hidden apart if you want the two to differ. No shader from outside the page reaches these events, neither the global row nor the tree default, so they read as no shader until you pick one, and picking one is the whole opt-in. Their timing still follows the global duration and curve unless you set it here. Window rules do not reach them either. A rule can name the Plasma applet popup window type, but these events resolve without consulting rules at all, so a broad rule cannot retarget a shader you picked here. Panels have no events of their own here, since a panel stays on screen for the whole session and hides by sliding under the screen edge, so it never opens or closes for an animation to play on. Decoration packs already reached both, and that is unchanged ([#950](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/950)).
- **Plasma applet popups report their own window type**: the application launcher and the system tray flyouts are a window type of their own, and PlasmaZones did not recognize it, so every one of them showed up as Unknown in the window picker on the Rules page. They now report as Plasma applet popup there, and the type appears in the window type list so a rule can name it. Toolbar windows had the same gap and now report as Toolbar, which that list already offered. A rule that matched either kind through the Unknown type before no longer does. PlasmaZones still does not place, tile or resize these surfaces, so naming the type lets a rule pick them out without changing what happens to them ([#925](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/925)).
- **Animations say when an event is holding settings from a shader it no longer uses**: settings you adjust on an event apply on top of the shader it inherits, and they are named for that shader, so changing the shader on the group above leaves them naming nothing. The event fell back to the new shader's own settings with no sign that anything of yours was still stored, and it stayed detached from any further settings the group made. The event's shader row now says it is following the inherited shader with saved settings that no longer apply, and the group's card says how many events below it are in that state and offers to discard those settings so they follow the group again. Discarding is offered rather than done for you, because pointing the group back at the earlier shader brings the settings back into use. Settings that still name something the new shader offers are left alone, and so is an event that has a shader of its own ([#951](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/951)).
- **Two tab switches in the Phosphor style**: the branded set gains the one animation class it did not cover. Phosphor Transfer breaks the old tab into luminous dust along a climbing frontier and re-forms the new one out of it, so the same material reads as reshaped rather than replaced. Phosphor Iris opens a turbulent ring of plasma from the center of the column, already carrying the tab you picked inside it. Both take the brand gradient from cyan through to rose and expose it as color settings like the rest of the set ([#908](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/908)).
- **Three geometry-leg helpers for animation pack authors**: the shared animation header gains `legTranslation`, `legTravelShare` and `legDirection`, which describe a move in terms a pack can use directly. `legTranslation` gives the part of the move the whole window shares, `legTravelShare` says how much of the leg is travel rather than a change of size, and `legDirection` gives the axis the window went along. The bundled geometry packs use them, and a pack you write yourself can too. The shader validator checks more of `metadata.json` alongside them: texture paths must sit inside the pack and name a file that exists, wrap and filter modes must use the vocabulary the runtime accepts, and the buffer pass list must fit the four pass budget with no empty entries. Every bundled pack already passes, so this only affects packs you author yourself.
- **Overlay shader packs can declare 8-bit buffers**: a multipass overlay pack whose intermediate buffers hold plain color can set `"halfFloatBuffers": false` in its metadata to halve the memory bandwidth its buffer passes consume. The bundled Nexus Cascade pack does so. Packs that never set the key keep full half-float precision, so nothing changes visually unless a pack opts in ([#872](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/872)).
- **Brazilian Portuguese translation**: PlasmaZones is now fully translated into Brazilian Portuguese, covering the daemon, the layout editor, the settings app and the KCM. All 3981 strings are filled, including the plural forms and the settings search keywords, so the interface reads in Portuguese as soon as your locale is set to pt_BR ([#975](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/975)).
- **Settings pages show a loading indicator**: opening a heavy settings page for the first time used to leave the viewport empty while the page built in the background, which read as a hang. The settings window now shows a centered spinner with a short caption over that area while the page is still building, and it disappears the moment the page is ready. It only appears after a brief moment of continuous loading, so pages that build quickly never flash it ([#930](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/930)).
- **The shortcut cheatsheet fills its columns evenly**: a long group used to tower over its neighbours, because each group had to fit in one column. Groups now flow across columns like a newspaper, and a group that runs past a column boundary continues in the next one under a repeated heading ([#864](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/864)).

### Changed

- **The daemon and the KWin effect must be installed together**: the protocol between them widened over this release, and a signal hook built against an old shape breaks rather than degrading. The protocol version floor moved to 5, and the two now refuse a mismatched pairing at startup rather than acting on a message they have misread. Packagers must rebuild and ship both binaries from the same source ([#890](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/890), [#892](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/892), [#895](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/895), [#908](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/908), [#922](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/922), [#923](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/923), [#933](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/933)).
- **Breaking D-Bus interface split**: the shared engine transport moved from org.plasmazones.Autotile to the engine-neutral org.plasmazones.Tiling interface, which serves every tiling-family engine. The moved surface covers the window lifecycle calls (windowOpened, windowsOpenedBatch, windowClosed, windowMinSizeUpdated, notifyWindowFocused), the tile-request and float signals (windowsTileRequested, focusWindowRequested, windowFloatingChanged, tilingChanged, windowsReleasedFromTiling), the retile methods, the enabled property with its change signal, and the screen set, now published as the union property managedScreens. The org.plasmazones.Autotile name still exists but is narrower now, carrying algorithm selection, master operations, focus cycling, and autotile configuration beside the new org.plasmazones.Scrolling interface. Check any external script against the new interface files before relying on it ([#852](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/852)).
- **Breaking D-Bus getter shape**: the three flat batch assignment getters on org.plasmazones.LayoutRegistry (getAllDesktopAssignments, getAllActivityAssignments, getAllCombinedAssignments) now return a map per key, carrying layoutId beside scrollingTemplate, instead of a bare layout-id string. The matching batch setters still accept plain layout-id strings, and templates are written through setScrollingTemplateLayout. No in-tree consumer read the old shape. External scripts reading these getters need the one-line adjustment ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887)).
- **Saved settings no longer freeze the defaults**: the configuration file now stores only values that differ from their default, and saving prunes previously stamped defaults. Before this, any save wrote every setting to disk, so a later release that retuned a default never reached a configuration saved under the old one. Any setting whose value differs from its default is kept exactly as before ([#874](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/874)).
- **The Layouts page became three per-mode library pages**: the tabbed Layouts page under Display is gone, and so is the Display category itself. Each placement mode now carries its own library page where its artifacts are created, imported and managed: Snapping → Layouts for zone layouts, Tiling → Library for algorithms, and Scrolling → Templates for templates. The pages are visible in both settings tiers, and in the simple rail each mode shows as an expandable header with its pages beneath it. Virtual Screens, the Display category's only other child, moved to the top level of the sidebar. A saved `--page layouts` deep link no longer resolves. The new page names are `snapping-layouts`, `tiling-library` and `scrolling-templates` ([#914](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/914)).
- **Turning tiling off now stops tiling everywhere**: the Tiling master switch already stopped tiling being offered and defaulted, but a screen carrying an explicit tiling algorithm could still tile with the feature switched off. Such a screen now falls back to snapping while the switch is off, so its zones, drag overlay and layout picker are all the snapping ones, and its algorithm is kept, so turning tiling back on puts the screen back the way it was ([#934](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/934)).
- **Restore to zone on login is now Restore to previous zone**: the rule action opts one application out of the Restore windows to their previous zone behavior while every other window keeps restoring, which suits a browser that hops between a work zone and a media zone. The old label undersold it, because the gate fires on every reopen during the session as well as after a logout, so it is named after the setting it overrides and its description spells that out ([#889](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/889), [#901](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/901)).
- **The rule action picker is organized by what an action affects**: the picker's Window entry used to be a long flat list with three small submenus tacked on the end, while Animation and Appearance sat beside it as separate top-level entries even though everything in them also applies to one window. Everything that acts on a window is now grouped under Window, in named submenus for Placement, Scrolling, Appearance, Animation, Behavior, and the two indicator color families, so the second level means the same thing everywhere in it. The border, title-bar, opacity and tint actions sit together under Window as Appearance, where they used to be a top-level entry of their own beside Window. Behavior is new and holds the window layer and the per-window scroll speed, which are neither placement nor looks. Because everything window-scoped now lives in one bucket, the divider between the entries that apply to a screen or desktop and the ones that apply to a window has a single entry below it rather than three ([#947](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/947)).
- **Fewer, more useful quick starts in the New Rule dialog**: the quick-start grid ran to five rows, and a good part of it was showcase examples the action picker now surfaces directly. It is down to eight tiles, each of which either sets up a context assignment or is one of the rules people actually open the dialog to write. Gone are the layout lock, the portrait-monitor example, the per-app zone-restore override, per-app decoration removal, and the small-window animation skip. The layout lock was the rule form of a shortcut you already have. Every action behind those tiles is still in the action picker, and the portrait-monitor and small-window ones also need a Screen orientation or Width condition, which the condition picker offers. Exclude an app from placement also gets a new icon, because a generic red X read as "delete" for a rule that deletes nothing, and unpinning reads as the deliberate opposite of the Open an app in a zone tile above it ([#947](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/947)).
- **Every color setting follows your color scheme until you pick one**: the zone overlay colors under Snapping → Overlay → Appearance and the border and tint colors under Appearance → Decorations → General now follow one per-color pattern. Each color shows the scheme color it currently follows, and picking one pins it while a Reset button on the row puts it back to following the scheme. The all-or-nothing "system accent color" switch on the overlay page is gone, so you can pin one color and leave the rest tracking your theme. The rule editor's color values present the same control, and the three border and tint color actions gain a Reset that puts a rule back to following the system accent. Zone overlay colors saved by an earlier version carry over when they were your own picks and resume following the scheme when the system colors switch was on, and a stored window border or tint "accent" value becomes the new follow-the-scheme state. Saved settings profiles from an earlier version are converted the same way when they load, where they used to be refused outright. On D-Bus, each color key gains a companion Raw key exposing the follow-or-pinned state directly, the schema type for the theme-following keys is the new themeColor token, and the color keys accept the empty value or the old "accent" spelling to put a color back on the scheme ([#899](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/899)).
- **Retile Windows moved off Spectacle's chord**: the default moved from `Meta+Ctrl+R` to `Meta+Ctrl+T`. Spectacle registers every Meta-modified R chord for its screenshot and recording shortcuts, and the system hands a contested chord to whichever application registered first, so on a stock Plasma install the old default either never fired or blocked Spectacle. The new default applies to fresh installs and to anyone who resets the shortcut. A custom binding saved in the system shortcuts store keeps whatever it holds ([#897](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/897)).
- **The shortcut cheatsheet reads in order and spells out every action**: rows inside each group used to appear in whatever order the shortcuts were registered over time, so related actions sat far apart. Each group now reads in a deliberate order, and the digit rows always close their group. The rows that folded two opposed actions into one line, such as Rotate and Cycle Focus, are unfolded, so every action shows its own line with its own chord. The arrow quads and the numbered 1-9 families still collapse, because those read as one gesture over one set of keys ([#960](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/960)).
- **Snap Assist thumbnails now travel over the graphics card by default**: the zero-copy transport that hands each thumbnail to the daemon as a GPU buffer, instead of copying its pixels through the session bus, used to be off unless you set `PLASMAZONES_DMABUF_THUMBNAILS`. It is now the normal path, and setting that variable to `0` turns it back off. The pixel transport stays in place as the automatic fallback, so a driver, graphics backend or buffer format that cannot carry the shared buffer still shows thumbnails rather than program icons, and nothing about the pickers looks different either way ([#968](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/968)).
- **Snap Assist thumbnails arrive faster and are captured at the size the card draws them**: every window picker used to capture each candidate at a fixed 256 pixel size, one settle delay at a time, so a picker with a dozen candidates spent a fifth of a second just waiting. The captures now run as one batch and are sized to the card that will draw them, so a crowded picker ships small buffers and a lone candidate in a large zone on a HiDPI screen is no longer upscaled. The zero-copy path gives each thumbnail its own buffer, which fixes blank thumbnails when more than three candidates arrived at once. Setting `PLASMAZONES_THUMBNAIL_TRACE=1` logs one timing line per thumbnail on both sides for diagnosis ([#954](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/954)).
- **Decoration corner radius reaches 64 pixels**: every decoration pack that offers a Corner radius parameter used to stop at 32 pixels. The ceiling is now 64, so a pack can round a thick panel or a large popup all the way. Existing values are unchanged ([#925](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/925)).
- **Decoration animations now play on the focused window only by default**: continuously animated decoration packs used to redraw every decorated window on every frame. The new default animates just the window you are working in, and unfocused windows hold their last frame. The "Animate only the active window" switch under Settings → Appearance → Decorations → General, shown when the advanced settings are on, turns the old behavior back on ([#872](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/872)).
- **The zone overlay frees its graphics memory when idle**: after a drag ends and the short grace period passes, the zone overlay's shader now releases its render targets and textures instead of holding them for the daemon's whole lifetime. On integrated graphics that memory comes out of system RAM, so an idle PlasmaZones now gives it back ([#872](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/872)).

### Removed

- **Importing colors from pywal or a JSON file**: the Snapping overlay appearance page had a From pywal button and a From file button that read a color file and pushed its palette into the zone colors. The import ran once and kept no link to the file, so changing your wallpaper left the zone colors on the old palette. Every color it could set has its own picker on the same page, and those pickers now follow your color scheme until you pin one ([#904](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/904)).

### Fixed

- **Closed windows reopen the way they left**: reopening a window brought back the oldest remembered placement for an application rather than the newest, so a long-gone arrangement could outrank the state the window actually closed in. Every fresh window also writes a bookkeeping note into the placement memory before the restore runs, and the restore treated that note as the window's final answer instead of looking for the state the window closed in, which made a floated window re-tile on reopen. A reopen now restores the newest remembered state that does not belong to a still-open window, and closes record their placement while the engine still knows the window. This applies in Tiling mode and in Scrolling mode ([#886](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/886)).
- **Escape cancels a re-insert without cancelling the drag**: with "always re-insert" turned on for scrolling or tiling, pressing Escape mid-drag used to cancel the whole window move, because the placement machinery never saw the key. It now dismisses just the re-insert, the same as Escape does for the zone overlay when snapping, and the window stays in your hand as a plain move. Holding a trigger instead of using always-on already worked this way, since releasing the trigger cancels the re-insert ([#873](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/873)).
- **Much less GPU work during window animations, especially on integrated graphics**: while any window animation played, PlasmaZones forced a full repaint of every monitor on every frame, and a decorated window was fully re-rendered and re-composited each frame even when its content had not changed. Animations now repaint only the screens they actually touch, and a decorated window's cached content survives the animation. This matters most on laptops and other machines with integrated graphics ([#872](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/872)).
- **Static decorated windows stay pixel-sharp while an undecorated window animates**: playing any window animation used to switch vertex snapping off for every decorated window, so on a fractionally scaled display the ones sitting still were softly resampled for the animation's duration. Only an animation on a decorated window relaxes snapping now, so moving an undecorated window leaves the rest of the desktop crisp and saves the full-screen resampling work on integrated graphics ([#872](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/872)).
- **Surface packs can declare that they leave the window's interior alone**: every decorated window told KWin it was translucent, so windows fully hidden behind it kept being composited, such as a video playing behind a maximized window. A surface pack whose drawing stays in the transparent margin around the window can now declare `"interiorOpaque": true` in its metadata, and a window whose whole chain declares it is no longer marked translucent. A pack that draws outside the window's own rectangle is still presented as an enlarged quad, which the compositor also excludes from occlusion culling, so a pack has to keep its drawing inside the window's rectangle to get the culling back. Border packs genuinely thin the window's own corner and edge pixels, so they correctly keep the translucent marking ([#872](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/872)).
- **Snap Assist keeps showing window thumbnails**: after a snap or two the window picker fell back to program icons and stayed on them until the daemon was restarted. The daemon clears its thumbnail cache half a minute after the picker closes, and the KWin effect went on skipping the windows it believed were still cached, so nothing ever re-captured them. The two sides now agree and the picker shows thumbnails every time. Several capture faults are fixed alongside it. A window with no drawable frame yet no longer posts an invisible thumbnail, a small window is no longer enlarged to thumbnail size and blurred, an offscreen render no longer leaks a texture per capture, and a thumbnail that fails to load now falls back to the program icon instead of leaving an empty square. Clicking and hovering a card also stays reliable while thumbnails are still arriving, because an arriving thumbnail no longer rebuilds the whole picker. The zero-copy transport had its own form of the same fault from the second picker onward, and its thumbnails arrived upside down. Both are fixed ([#902](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/902)).
- **The built-in Steam rule kept every Steam game out of tiling**: the rule shipped to stop Steam's own popups being tiled matched any window whose class mentioned steam. A game launched from Steam carries a class like `steam_app_2342813033`, which mentions steam, so every game matched, and the rule then took it out of tiling, snapping and scrolling and stripped its borders and decoration packs as well. The rule now names the windows it guards, Steam's own notification popups, and leaves the rest alone, so the Friends List, chat windows, Big Picture, Settings and every game place like any other window. It matches the popup name on either the window title or the window class, because which of the two Steam puts it in is not settled, and it also only takes the matched popups out of placement now, leaving their decorations and their animation overrides alone. A config that still carries the old rule untouched is corrected on the next start and the rule is renamed to Steam notifications, so it says in the list what it now guards. A copy you have edited yourself is left exactly as you left it, and one you had turned off stays off ([#947](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/947)).
- **A monocle window unmaximized by hand no longer leaves the two sides disagreeing**: unmaximizing a monocle window while the daemon connection was down dropped the compositor side's record of it straight away, even though the float could not be announced, so the compositor had forgotten the window while the daemon still counted it as tiled. The window now leaves the layout only once the daemon can be told, the same way leaving windowed fullscreen already worked ([#906](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/906)).
- **A window moved quickly between monitors keeps the right size**: restoring a window's pre-tile size after a cross-screen hop was carried out in a deferred step with no generation marker, so two hops in quick succession left both steps live and the older one applied the first hop's size. The window ended up sized for the monitor it had already left. Each hop now marks its own restore and a superseded one is discarded ([#906](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/906)).
- **Negated window rules no longer fire on every window**: an appearance or animation rule built as "none of" over the Active layout or Tiled window count fields matched every window on screen, because the compositor side never filled those fields in and an empty value made the inner test fail everywhere. Active layout is now filled in properly, and rules over Tiled window count are kept to the surfaces that can answer it ([#887](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/887)).
- **A rule started from a quick start or a subject can take more conditions**: those starting points hand you a rule with a single condition and no way to add a second, because the Add condition and Add group buttons only appeared once a rule already had a group of conditions. Only the Animation and Custom starting points escaped it. A rule with one condition now offers both buttons, and using either puts the condition you have and the new one into a group together. Rules you already created this way get the buttons too ([#947](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/947)).
- **A rule no longer offers animation events it cannot change**: the Override animation actions offered around sixty events to pick from, and only ten of them are ones a rule can affect. A rule matches windows, so it can only change an animation that belongs to a window. Picking a virtual desktop switch, a scrolling strip movement, an OSD, a zone selector or snap assist popup, a side panel, a cursor or widget effect, an editor action or a Plasma shell popup gave you an action that saved without complaint and then never ran, with nothing anywhere to say why. Those events are no longer offered. A rule you already made that names one keeps it, still shown by name, now marked with a warning you can hover or tab to for the reason ([#952](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/952)).
- **Adjusting a shader setting no longer detaches the event from the group above it**: on any Animations page, if you set a shader on a parent row like All Windows and then changed one of its settings on a single event underneath, that event quietly stopped following the parent. Changing the parent's shader afterwards left that one event on the old one. The parent's card also started warning that a child was overriding it, and offered a button that would have deleted the adjustment you had just made. Settings you change on an event now apply on top of the shader it inherits instead of pinning a copy of it, so the event keeps following the parent's shader, and the warning appears only when an event really has a shader choice of its own. Picking that same shader again from the list, to make it the event's own, no longer discards the settings you had already adjusted ([#951](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/951)).
- **An event's shader row now says what it has, and its buttons do what they say**: the row looked the same whether the shader was the event's own or inherited from the group above, while the curve and duration rows either side of it both said which they were. It now says one of three things, because an event can also keep the inherited shader while having its own settings for it, which nothing used to show. The delete button read Remove alongside the shader's name even when the event had nothing of its own to remove, and on an event that did have its own shader it did not remove it either. It left the event with no shader at all. Removing now removes, so the event goes back to following the group above, and where there is nothing of its own to remove the button says instead that it will leave the event with no shader. Picking None from the shader list is still how you choose that deliberately. An event left with no shader now says so, and offers a way back to following the group ([#951](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/951)).
- **An animation setting that cannot be saved now says so, once**: if the folder your animation settings live in was read-only or the disk was full, moving the duration slider or picking a curve did nothing at all, with no message and nothing in the log. Worse, the controls went dead for the rest of the session, so there was no way to try again after fixing the problem. A failed save now tells you once, however many events the edit covered, and the controls keep working so you can retry as soon as the disk is writable again. It tells you again if a later save fails after one has succeeded ([#951](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/951)).
- **A decoration stays on a window while it closes**: a decoration pack rode a closing window out of view only when PlasmaZones was playing the close animation itself. When anything else animated the window away, such as the slide a Plasma applet popup plays as you dismiss it, the pack stopped drawing the instant the window closed and the last of the animation played bare. The decoration now stays for as long as the compositor keeps drawing the window, so a decorated launcher or system tray popup wears its pack all the way out, and so does an ordinary window closing with the PlasmaZones animations turned off ([#950](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/950)).
- **Resizing a window no longer tears the animation apart**: the geometry animation packs that carry a sense of travel read how far a window went from the movement of its centre. A window held at one edge and made wider or taller moves its centre by half the size change while the window itself stays where it is, so those packs treated a resize as a long journey and applied the full effect to it. Phosphor Stream cut the window into lanes that reached their new size at different moments and bowed apart sideways, and Flow and Stretch let one side arrive ahead of the other, which read as the window jumping and settling rather than resizing. This showed up most on a scrolling screen, where cycling the column width or the window height resizes against a held edge every time. The three packs now measure the part of the move the whole window shares, so a window that only changes size grows and shrinks evenly while a window that genuinely travels keeps the full effect, and a move that does both eases between the two. Fold and Ripple Snap never came apart this way, but they took their fold and ripple direction from the same reading and now follow the axis that actually changed.
- **The shader validator checks the animation packs it used to wave through**: `plasmazones-shader-validate` picks each pack's authoring model from the pack itself now, so pointing it at an animation or surface pack without remembering the matching flag no longer runs the zone checks over it and reports two errors that were only ever artifacts of the wrong checker. The flags still force a model, and all three kinds of pack can be validated in one run. Separately, 35 of the 94 bundled animation packs were only ever having their metadata checked, because they run in the compositor and their shader source is a dialect the offline compiler refuses. Those packs are now compiled through glslang for real, both stages, which covers every desktop transition and the whole geometry set. The run fails if glslang is missing rather than passing quietly, since nothing else checks those packs when there is no graphics card to test on.

## [3.3.9] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **The daemon crashed on startup after the Qt 6.11.2 update**: window tiling stopped working entirely, and the daemon restarted and crashed in a loop rather than coming up. PlasmaZones reads part of Qt's internal Wayland state directly, and the update moved that state, so the daemon read from the wrong place and crashed on whatever happened to be there. This release is built against the new Qt. Anyone who installed from a distribution package needs the rebuilt package from their distribution, not just a restart ([#936](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/936)).

## [3.3.8] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **The active layout of each monitor is published on the session bus**: `org.plasmazones.LayoutRegistry` gained a `getActiveLayoutsForScreens` readback and an `activeLayoutForScreenChanged` signal, so the compositor and other subscribers can follow which layout each monitor is on ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).

### Fixed

- **Window rules that match on "Active layout" now work**: a rule such as "snap this app to zone 1 when the active layout is 4K" never fired, no matter which app or zone it named. PlasmaZones knew which layout was active when it resolved settings that apply to a whole monitor, but not when it resolved a rule for one window, so the layout the rule asked about always read as blank and the match failed. Rules matching on the active layout now resolve against the layout assigned to the monitor the window is on, which also makes rules that match on a specific monitor work for floating and position restore ([#919](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/919), [#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **Rules that match on "Screen orientation" now work on window rules**: this condition had the same problem as "Active layout" and was silently broken in the same way. Pairing it with an action that applies when a window opens, such as float, snap to zone, or move to another monitor, matched nothing at all, while an "is not" version of the same condition matched every window. It now resolves against the monitor the window is opening on ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **Rules that exclude windows now update when you change focus or move a window to another monitor**: an exclusion rule was answered once per window and the answer was kept, so a rule such as "exclude while floating" could leave a window unmanaged and undecorated after it stopped floating. Focus changes, monitor changes, and layout changes now re-check exclusions, and a setup whose only rules are exclusions is no longer skipped entirely ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **Turning autotile off and on again keeps each monitor's tiling algorithm**: the algorithm chosen per monitor was saved when autotile was turned off, and then overwritten with the global default when it was turned back on, so every monitor came back on the same algorithm ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **Turning autotile off and on again brings it back on your other virtual desktops and activities**: switching autotile off cleared it from every desktop and activity, while switching it back on only ever reached the desktop you were looking at. Every other desktop and activity stayed on snapping with no way back except assigning autotile to each one by hand ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **A window set to move to another monitor now moves even when it also has a "snap to zone" action**: if the monitor it was being sent to was using autotile, the snap could not be applied there, and the window was then left where it opened instead of being moved. The same rule without the snap action moved it correctly ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **Windows restored at login are no longer wrongly treated as belonging to another app**: PlasmaZones compares process ids to spot a second app opening a window of the same type. During session restore a window's process id is not known yet, and the unknown value was compared as though it were real, which suppressed the snap position of windows restored alongside it ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **Windows whose process id is unknown are no longer grouped with each other**: the checks that decide whether several windows of one app are open treated every window with an unknown process id as the same process, so unrelated windows were counted together while their ids were still missing ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **A monitor left out of a batch of layout changes is now re-snapped**: saving assignments for some monitors and not others left the omitted ones showing their previous placement until something else moved them ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **A settings window that dies while saving no longer silences layout changes**: the daemon muted its own layout-change signals for the duration of a save, and a settings app that quit or crashed mid-save never unmuted them, so nothing the daemon did afterwards reached the compositor until it was restarted ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **The per-monitor state readback no longer reports the previous desktop or activity**: right after a virtual-desktop or activity switch it still answered with the context you had just left ([#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).
- **Border and opacity rules can match on "Active layout" too**: the appearance a window is drawn with is resolved inside the compositor, which had no way to know which layout a monitor was using, so an "Active layout is" condition on a border, tint, opacity, or window-layer rule never matched there either. The compositor now tracks each monitor's active layout and re-draws affected windows when it changes, including on a virtual-desktop or activity switch ([#919](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/919), [#921](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/921)).

## [3.3.7] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **The panel query no longer crashes the Plasma desktop while a monitor reconnects**: PlasmaZones asks plasmashell where its panels sit so zones can avoid them. When that query arrived while an output was being torn down and rebuilt, which happens when a monitor wakes from sleep or renegotiates its DisplayPort link, plasmashell read panel settings through a screen that no longer existed and crashed, taking the whole desktop with it. The query now skips panels whose screen is gone and no longer reads the two panel properties that triggered the crash ([#916](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/issues/916), [#917](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/917)).

## [3.3.6] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **Windows are no longer blurry on a display scaled to exactly 150%**: every window PlasmaZones draws a border on stayed persistently soft at 150%, while 125% was affected only at some window positions and other fractional scales such as 148.33% were fine. The offscreen surface those windows are drawn through was positioned half a device pixel away from where the compositor rounds it to, and half a pixel is the one offset that rounding cannot absorb, so the surface was stretched by a single pixel and resampled ([#868](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/868), [#884](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/884)).
- **Window content no longer stretches while a window snaps or tiles**: the default geometry animation drew the window's content squeezed into the rectangle it was travelling through, so text and icons were distorted for the length of the animation and then snapped sharp at the end. The content is now drawn at its final size throughout and the animation reveals it as the window grows ([#868](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/868), [#884](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/884)).
- **Choosing "None" for a snap animation no longer distorts the window either**: with no animation shader selected, the fallback animation scaled the window's content the same way. It now animates only where the window sits ([#884](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/884)).
- **Your own animation and decoration packs now override the bundled ones**: a pack you installed under your home directory with the same name as one that ships with PlasmaZones was ignored for windows, while the daemon still used yours for on-screen displays and popups, so the same pack could look different in the two places ([#884](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/884)).

## [3.3.4] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **Windows on the lower-scale monitor of a mixed-DPI setup are no longer slightly blurry**: with monitors running at different scales, every window PlasmaZones draws a border on stayed persistently soft on the lower-scale monitor whenever it sat against the edge shared with the higher-scale monitor. The window's shadow reaches past that edge, and the offscreen surface the window is drawn through followed the neighbouring monitor's higher scale and was then scaled back down. The surface now follows the scale of the monitor the window's visible frame is on ([#868](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/868), [#881](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/881)).

## [3.3.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **Windows are no longer blurry on a fractionally scaled display**: on an output running at a scale like 1.5x, every window PlasmaZones draws a border on looked persistently soft, and resizing it flickered with stretched frames. The offscreen surface those windows are drawn through was sized and positioned off the display's pixel grid, and it was resampled with vertex snapping turned off at all times rather than only while an animation is playing ([#868](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/868), [#869](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/869)).
- **Dragging a window on a monitor that has no zone layout no longer snaps it**: with the default layout assignment suppressed, a monitor without a layout of its own still hit-tested drags against the global default layout, so dragging there could snap the window into zones the monitor does not have while the zone highlight lit up on the other monitor. Drags on such a monitor now move the window freely, and the highlight stays off ([#724](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/724), [#867](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/867)).
- **Unminimizing a window no longer snaps it back to a zone on another monitor**: a window snapped on one monitor and then moved to another kept its old zone on record, and minimizing and unminimizing it teleported it back into that zone. The minimize round trip now always keeps the window on the monitor it is actually on. The manual float toggle still returns a window to its remembered zone across monitors ([#724](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/724), [#867](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/867)).
- **Zone shortcuts and snap assist skip a monitor with no zone layout**: moving a window to an adjacent zone, or the picker offered after a snap, could still act on the global default layout's zones for a monitor that has none. Both now do nothing on such a monitor ([#724](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/724), [#867](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/867)).

## [3.3.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **The layout editor no longer opens another screen's layout when you switch screens**: switching the editor to a screen that has no layout of its own loaded the default layout for editing, so renaming it and saving overwrote that layout and both screens ended up on the same one. An unassigned screen now starts you on a fresh layout ([#858](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/858), [#862](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/862)).
- **Settings dropdowns show the value you actually have saved**: eleven dropdowns in the settings app always displayed their first option however your configuration was set, so Drag behavior, Sticky windows, the rendering backend and others looked like they were set to something you had never chosen. Re-picking the real value was then a no-op, so nothing prompted you to save ([#860](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/860), [#863](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/863)).
- **Minimized windows stay out of tiling across a mode switch**: switching a screen between snapping and tiling no longer counts minimized windows in the tiled layout or moves them, and unminimizing restores each window to the place it had before it was minimized, on either engine and across restarts ([#859](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/859)).
- **The support report script no longer needs Perl's JSON::PP module**: some distros package Perl core modules separately, so `plasmazones-report` failed with a module error and wrongly reported that the daemon was not running. The script now does all of its text processing with python3 ([#861](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/861)).

## [3.3.1] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **The curve revert link names the field it reverts**: it now reads "Revert curve to inherited", matching the duration link beside it ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **The curve editor is titled after the event it edits**: it reads `Customize curve for <event>`, or just `Customize curve` where there is no single event to name ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **The spring Speed and Damping ratio hints read as sentences** instead of comparison operators ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **The editor's save action is spelled "Save as preset…" everywhere**, and a built-in preset row gained a "Use as default" action ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **The settings app explains a refused edit**: it shows a short notice when an edit is refused during a discard, or when some overrides could not be reverted ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).

### Fixed

- **Your customised shortcuts survive a service restart**: restarting the PlasmaZones service, which happens on every logout and upgrade, reset every shortcut you had rebound in System Settings back to the defaults. The daemon released its shortcuts on shutdown in a way that also deleted their saved bindings ([#851](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/851), [#855](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/855)).
- **Editing a tiling style's settings and then switching styles keeps the edit**: when one settings reload both changed a style's tuning and switched the active style, stale values were written over the slot you had just edited, so changing a style's max windows and picking another style silently reverted the change ([#853](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/853), [#854](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/854)).
- **Setting a tiling style's max windows to that style's own default now takes effect**: the write was silently dropped, so the slider showed the new value while windows were still evicted at the old cap ([#856](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/856)).
- **A screen tiled with a different style than the global one honours your saved max windows**: picking a tiling layout from the overview leaves that screen on its own style, and such screens ignored the window cap you had saved for that style and stayed at its built-in default ([#856](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/856)).
- **Reverting an animation's duration or curve shows the inherited value right away**: the per-field revert links cleared the override but left the control showing the value you had just removed, and it only caught up the next time you opened the settings app. Turning an event's Override toggle off and resetting an animations page had the same problem and are fixed too ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **Clearing an override on the Global animation card now updates the events below it**: every event inheriting from Global kept showing the old value until the page was rebuilt ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **Editing a profile file by hand while the settings app is open is picked up**: the page cached what it had read and never re-read it, so your edit did not show until you reopened the app ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **A curve or profile file you fix in place is noticed**: a file that failed to load was not watched, so repairing the typo did nothing until the next restart. The same applies to a shader or animation pack folder copied in whole, which could be missed if its `metadata.json` landed a moment after the folder ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **A curve preset now carries the duration of the event you saved it from**: it recorded the global default instead, so a preset saved from a 400 ms event played at whatever the global value was. Using the preset applies that duration too, and the curve preview inside the editor runs at it. A spring preset records no duration at all, because a spring settles on its own physics ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **An animation event card's body is no longer greyed out**: the card drew its contents dimmed while its controls stayed fully clickable ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).
- **A malformed value in a profile file is inherited instead of silently pinning the event**: writing something that is not a number for a duration, minimum distance or stagger interval used to record the built-in default as an explicit override, so the event stopped following its parent and the settings app showed a value nobody chose. It now falls through to the parent like any other unset field, and the daemon logs what it ignored ([#850](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/850)).

## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Settings profiles**: save your whole configuration and rules as a named profile and switch between them. Before a profile is applied you see a diff of exactly what will change, and applying is staged so nothing is written until you confirm. Profiles inherit from one another, so a profile only records what it changes from its parent ([#793](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/793)).
- **Simple and advanced settings modes**: the settings app now has a simple mode that flattens the sidebar into a single list and trims each page to the settings most people need, with an advanced toggle in the sidebar footer for the full set. New condensed Snapping, Tiling, and Animations pages carry the common controls, and switching modes keeps you on the same setting wherever it exists in both ([#822](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/822)).
- **The whole settings interface is translatable now**: the QML strings that make up the settings UI were never being pulled into the translation catalog, so the interface fell back to English in every language however complete the translation looked. The full UI is now extracted and translated into German, Georgian, Swedish, Dutch, Polish, and Russian ([#840](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/840)).
- **Keyboard zone spanning**: new Span Window shortcuts (Ctrl+Alt+Arrows) grow the focused window's snap into the adjacent zone in that direction, the keyboard counterpart of spanning zones with a drag. Pressing back toward the window shrinks it again, and growing into a column of stacked zones takes the whole column so the window stays rectangular ([#93](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/93), [#838](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/838)).
- **Shortcut cheatsheet overlay**: a new overlay that lists every PlasmaZones global shortcut with the keys you actually have bound, grouped by category. Open it with Meta+Alt+/ (rebindable in System Settings) and dismiss it with Escape, a backdrop click, or the shortcut again. The sheet is mode aware. Shortcuts that do nothing in the current tiling mode are hidden, and it updates live when you switch modes or rebind a key. Shortcuts you have unbound stay listed as unassigned so you can discover them ([#810](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/810)).

### Changed

- **Per-event animation timing overrides only change the field you edit**: turning on the override for an animation event used to immediately pin the inherited duration and curve as fixed overrides, so the event quietly stopped following the global defaults even though you had changed nothing. The override toggle now just opens the editor and writes nothing, and editing the duration or the curve overrides only that field. Each field shows whether it follows the inherited value or is overridden, with a link to revert it ([#837](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/837)).
- **Animation shader pickers now describe the shader you picked**: choosing a shader for an animation event shows the pack's description, and the description and parameters fold into a collapsible section that opens with a click, the same way decoration packs behave ([#834](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/834)).
- **Picking an animation shader works like picking a decoration pack**: the pack you chose now gets its own named row, with a remove button and its description and parameters behind the same collapsible chevron a decoration surface uses. The picker moved below that row as a "Set shader pack" action, so choosing a pack replaces what is there and choosing None clears it. A pack that is no longer installed now reads as missing instead of showing its internal id. The decoration pages read the same way ([#839](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/839)).

### Fixed

- **Switching the tiling algorithm no longer changes your max windows**: picking a different algorithm wrote that algorithm's default window count into the global Max windows setting, which then showed up as an unexpected change in your configuration. Each algorithm's window count is now kept with the algorithm ([#820](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/820)).
- **Windows keep their minimum size in overlapping and stacked layouts**: in the deck, theater, and floating-center layouts a zone could be forced smaller than a window's minimum size. Those layouts now grow an undersized zone to fit. Overlapping layouts also stack in a defined order, so deck keeps the first window on top while cascade and the others bring new windows to the front, and rotating the window order in monocle brings the newly shown window to the top ([#829](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/829)).
- **Layout and shader cards fill the grid and stay readable at any size**: at wide window sizes the last card in each row could wrap and leave an empty slot on the right, and small layout cards shrank their name and badges along with the preview until the text could not be read. The grid now uses the full width, and a layout card's preview scales while its labels keep their own size ([#828](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/828)).
- **The layout right-click menu works again**: right-clicking a layout and choosing "Set as Default" or "Hide from Zone Selector" did nothing, because the menu never received the settings it needed to act on ([#827](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/827)).
- **Editing a layout no longer scrolls the page back to the top**: hiding a layout, changing its auto-assign, or picking an aspect ratio while scrolled down threw the Layouts page back to the top. The page now holds its position while the cards rebuild. The Shaders pages keep their position across a group or sort change for the same reason ([#827](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/827)).
- **Layout cards no longer flicker when you change one**: toggling a layout's visibility or auto-assign briefly redrew every card without its badges, and the one you just changed snapped back before it took. Each change now refreshes the list once, with everything in place ([#827](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/827)).
- **Overlay shaders with a depth buffer render cleanly**: the Neon City and Voxel Terrain overlays asked the graphics driver to read and write the same depth texture in one drawing pass, which it refused ([#827](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/827)).
- **Zone overlay corners now round like window decorations**: every overlay pack worked out its corners on its own, so they disagreed with the decoration packs and with each other. On a scaled display the corners came out too tight, because the radius was treated as if the display were unscaled. Setting the radius to 0 still left rounded corners, by a different amount in each pack. A radius larger than half a narrow zone collapsed that zone into a sliver instead of rounding it. All 27 overlays now share the geometry the decorations use, so the radius you set is the radius you get, at any display scale. Border widths follow the display scale for the same reason ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Pulse Flow honours its Outer Glow Size setting**: the overlay stopped drawing at the distance the default setting reaches, so raising the slider past its default widened nothing and left a hard edge where the glow was cut ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Berry Drift's Drift Speed setting works**: the slider had no effect on how fast the blobs move. The speed you set was calculated and then dropped before it reached the blobs, which always drifted at a fixed rate ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Neon Venom no longer draws a ring around each zone**: the bioluminescent rim fades out with distance, but the overlay stopped drawing while the fade was still half bright, which showed up as a hard ring. Turning up audio reactivity or cursor influence made it worse, because both widen the fade ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **A border width of zero now turns the border off**: every overlay pack drew at least a one-pixel border no matter how low you set the width, so the bottom of the slider never reached "no border" ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Zone colors apply in six more overlays**: Berry Drift, Mosaic Pulse, Spectrum Bloom, Spectrum Pulse, Toxic Circuit, and Voxel Terrain ignored the fill or border color set for a zone, so changing it did nothing in those packs. They now tint with it the way the other overlays do ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Chrome Protocol's Animation Speed and Ring Base Thickness sliders work**: both were shown in settings and read by nothing, so the rings always turned and thickened at a fixed rate. The overlay is also much cheaper to draw, because it no longer raytraces the console for parts of the screen no zone covers ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Magnetic Field respects its own settings again**: inactive zones were meant to thin out their particle field and did not, and the Wave Speed slider was applied twice to the field lines, so they ran roughly nine times too fast at the top of the range and too slow at the bottom ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Overlay glows keep their proportions on a scaled display**: in 26 of the 27 packs a glow reach, an edge fade, or a travelling ring was measured in raw pixels while the border and corner beside it followed the display scale. On a HiDPI screen the parts drifted apart, and Berry Drift cut its glow off mid-gradient and left a ring ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Settings that did nothing are gone**: EndeavourOS Drift showed an Orbit Radius and a Connection Threshold slider, Chrome Protocol showed two sliders labelled "Reserved", and Berry Drift showed an Animation Speed slider that duplicated its Drift Speed. None of them were read by anything ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **Eight overlay descriptions match what they draw**: Fedora Drift described neon tubes against a northern-lights sky when it draws frosted glass over data streams, NixOS Drift described nebula pulse borders when its border is a wave of lighting hexagons, EndeavourOS Drift described a constellation of orbiting dots when it draws wind currents behind parallax sails, Sonic Ripple said its rings start at the zone center when they start at the middle of the screen, Spectrum Bloom said the zone boundary itself morphs when the contour is only seen through the zone, Chrome Protocol said mids drive the ring rotation when they widen the camera orbit, CachyOS Drift said bass shatters the facets when it scatters them, and openSUSE Drift called its Geeko a constructive SDF when it is a single polygon ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).
- **EndeavourOS Drift's sliders are named for what they do**: five sliders and their group were still labelled for an orbiting-dot constellation the overlay does not draw. They now read as Wind Speed, Current Brightness, Sail Brightness, and Sail Center X and Y, with the three that describe the wind and the sail placement grouped under Wind ([#841](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/841)).

## [3.2.7] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **Rapid desktop peek toggles no longer show an empty screen**: toggling desktop peek faster than its animation could run cancelled the first pass, and the second one then drew nothing. The animation now reuses the earlier capture, so the second toggle plays through ([#823](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/823)).
- **Manual autotile adjustments survive an autotile toggle**: resizing the columns or rows of an autotiled layout and then toggling autotile off and back on reset the layout to a uniform split. Your adjustments are now kept across the toggle ([#824](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/824)).

## [3.2.6] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Support reports include your global shortcut bindings**: shortcuts are registered with KDE's global shortcut service, so the binding that actually gets grabbed lives outside PlasmaZones' own configuration and the two can disagree. The report archive now captures that state, with home paths redacted ([#812](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/812)).
- **A note when a rule assigns a minimize or maximize animation**: the rule editor now explains that KDE's own minimize or maximize effect keeps running alongside your pack unless you turn it off in System Settings ([#819](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/819)).

### Fixed

- **Minimize and restore animations no longer freeze or smear**: on autotiled windows, KDE's magic lamp animation could stall partway with black streaks across the window, and the restore animation could be cut off partway through. PlasmaZones now waits for the compositor's animation to finish before it repositions the window ([#819](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/819)).
- **PlasmaZones animation packs no longer play on top of KDE's**: with a pack assigned to minimize or maximize, KDE's stock effect for that event ran at the same time. The stock effect is now stood down while your pack owns the event, and restored when it no longer does ([#819](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/819)).
- **Title bars no longer flash during a desktop switch**: with hidden title bars and a desktop-switch animation enabled, the outgoing desktop's tiled windows showed their title bars for the whole animation. Windows on other desktops are now left alone when a desktop retiles ([#813](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/813)).
- **A cleared shortcut can be assigned again**: clearing a keyboard shortcut dropped it from the daemon's registry, so assigning it a new key did nothing until the daemon restarted ([#812](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/812)).
- **Floating windows stay floating across desktop switches**: a floating window on a screen that switched between a snapping desktop and a tiling desktop could quietly stop counting as floating, so rules that match floating windows stopped applying to it ([#814](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/814)).
- **Floating a tiled window returns it to its real position**: floating a tiled window recorded the tile it was sitting in as its free position, so it floated back onto its own tile and its genuine free position was lost ([#818](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/818)).
- **Unfloating works after a restart**: a window floated before the daemon restarted had nowhere to go back to, so unfloating it did nothing. The saved placement record is now used as the fallback ([#818](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/818)).
- **Windows no longer come back floating on their own**: unfloating a window and then toggling between tiling and snapping could bring it back floating, because a window the snapping engine never tracked was recorded as floating ([#818](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/818)).
- **Less compositor work while windows move**: every geometry change re-evaluated your rules and refreshed the window's decoration before the usual delay, which added hundreds of rule evaluations per second on the compositor thread during animations. Both now run once per batch ([#819](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/819)).

## [3.2.5] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Tiled windows no longer scramble when switching virtual desktops**: switching between desktops that each have their own tiled windows could pull a window into the wrong desktop's tiling, leaving ghost tiles on one desktop and overlapping or floating windows on the other. The tiling state now switches to the new desktop before any window focus is processed, so each desktop keeps its own layout intact ([#806](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/806)).

## [3.2.4] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Rapid move shortcuts no longer jump back**: pressing a move-window shortcut again while the previous move was still animating made the window visibly jump back to where the sequence started and replay the animation from there. Redirecting a move mid-flight now continues smoothly from the window's current position ([#803](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/803)).

## [3.2.3] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Animations no longer freeze partway through**: seven animation packs (Fade, Fade Color, Broken Glass, Voronoi Shatter, Ink Splash, Inkwell Drop, and Desktop Phosphor) finished their visible motion early or started it late, so part of the transition looked frozen. Each pack now animates across its whole duration, in both directions ([#800](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/800)).
- **Counts show up in plural text again**: a few plural strings in the settings app, such as the zone count in the layout picker, displayed a literal placeholder instead of the number. The counts substitute correctly again ([#801](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/801)).

## [3.2.2] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Fuller support reports**: the support report archive now includes your rules, quick layouts, layout settings, and settings profiles, with home paths redacted, and the daemon's report gains a Rules section. Earlier reports were missing these files, which made several bug reports slow to diagnose ([#797](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/797)).

### Fixed

- **Global animation settings work again**: since 3.2.0, window animations ignored the global Duration and Curve settings and always played at a fixed 200 ms. Windows follow the global settings again, and a per-event override still wins where you set one ([#797](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/797)).
- **Cross-monitor moves no longer hop sideways**: moving a window down or up to another monitor could jump to a monitor beside the current one when your monitors have different heights. The move now only targets a monitor that actually lines up in the direction of the move ([#797](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/797)).
- **Settings survive concurrent writers**: when the settings app and the daemon wrote the configuration at the same time, a stale in-memory copy could resurrect old values over a just-saved change, and an external change notification could silently drop unsaved edits. Both paths now stay coherent ([#797](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/797)).
- **Per-page Reset and Discard stay on their page**: on the Decoration and Animations settings families, resetting or discarding one page could also revert its sibling pages. Each page now only touches its own settings ([#794](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/794)).
- **Resetting OSD and Popup decorations restores the built-in look**: resetting the Decoration → OSDs or Decoration → Popups page removed the built-in card border and shadow instead of restoring them. The built-in chrome is now a default layer underneath your edits, so reset brings it back, and setups that had already lost it heal on their own ([#798](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/798)).
- **Upside-down decorations on OpenGL**: window decorations could render flipped vertically on the OpenGL backend when two or more decoration packs were combined, and during show or hide transitions. The Vulkan backend was unaffected ([#798](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/798)).

## [3.2.1] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Six new translations**: PlasmaZones is now fully translated into German ([#785](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/785)), Georgian ([#786](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/786)), Swedish ([#787](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/787)), Dutch ([#788](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/788)), Polish ([#789](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/789)), and Russian ([#790](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/790)).

### Fixed

- **See-through overlay cards**: the on-screen display, the layout picker, and the zone selector were drawn with a translucent body, so the desktop could bleed through them. Each card is now drawn opaque with a border and drop shadow that follow your theme in both light and dark. If you had customized these surfaces and they still look wrong after upgrading, open the Decoration → OSDs and Decoration → Popups pages and reset each to its default ([#792](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/792)).
- **Decoration packs now follow theme colors on windows too**: a custom decoration pack on a window ignored the theme color options, so the neutral frame line and the theme-tinted glow or shadow only took effect on the overlay cards. All three now resolve on the window path as well ([#792](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/792)).

## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Theater, a widescreen layout**: keeps a single window centered at a width you set per monitor, so one window never has to stretch across a wide display. With more windows the focused one sits in a centered spotlight and the rest line up on rails in the margins on both sides, and focusing a rail window brings it into the spotlight ([#704](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/704)).
- **Window appearance and gaps are now rules**: window borders, title bars, corner radius, border colors, and gaps are controlled through the rule system instead of separate per-mode settings pages. A new Windows page under the Appearance category edits the managed defaults, and per-window or per-context overrides are ordinary rules on the Rules page ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **Match by placement mode**: a new Mode match condition matches snapped or tiled windows, so snapping and tiling can carry different gaps or appearance. Mode is a context condition, resolved per screen and layout ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **Per-monitor gaps**: pick a monitor from the scope chip on the Gaps card to set that screen's gaps independently. The values are stored as a screen-scoped rule ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **Separate focused and unfocused border colors**: the border color is now two actions, "Set focused border color" and "Set unfocused border color", each with its own swatch ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **App-managed default rules**: the default rules (Default borders, Default title bars, Default gaps) cannot be deleted and stay pinned to the lowest priority ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **Choose which windows the appearance defaults apply to**: the Borders and Title bars cards on the Appearance Windows page have an "Apply to" option with three scopes, tiled and snapped windows, all normal windows, and all windows. New installs default to tiled and snapped windows, so the default border and hidden title bar stay off the desktop, panels, popups, and on-screen displays. Existing setups keep their current scope and can switch at any time ([#721](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/721)).
- **Show desktop animations**: peeking at the desktop can now play a full-screen transition. Pick a pack for the new "Peeked at Desktop" event on the Animations → Transitions → Desktop page. Hiding the windows plays the pack forward and bringing them back plays it in reverse. Every desktop transition pack works here, and three new packs ship with it, Peek Recede, Peek Blinds, and Phosphor Peek. While a pack is set, PlasmaZones takes over from KWin's own show desktop animation and hands it back when the pack is cleared ([#777](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/777)).
- **Reset or discard one settings page at a time**: most settings pages now have a menu in the breadcrumb row with "Reset page to defaults" and "Discard changes on this page". Both stage the change so you can review it and then Save or Discard like any other edit, and discarding one page leaves your edits on other pages alone ([#726](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/726)).
- **More starting points in the New Algorithm wizard**: the template picker offers nine templates instead of four, adding Aligned Grid, Dwindle (Memory), Cluster, Theater, and Deck so the resize-aware, split-remembering, custom-parameter, focus-driven, and overlapping layout styles each have a working example to build on. The blank skeleton's capability checkboxes now also cover script state, single window, and follows focus, and the generated body shows the tiny-area guard pattern ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Genie and Phosphor Siphon, two minimize-to-icon animations**: Genie pours the window into its task manager icon like the classic magic lamp, with the edge nearest the icon leading, and restoring pours it back out. Phosphor Siphon does the same journey as separated luminous streams that carry the brand gradient and shed ember sparks, each stream fading into the icon as it lands. A window that is not in any task manager drains into its own bottom edge instead ([#776](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/776)).
- **Window decoration effects**: a new Decoration category adds shader effects that draw behind and around your windows, picked from a pack browser and saved as reusable sets. Glass, Frosted Glass, and Rippled Glass refract the real blurred backdrop, Blur softens it, and Drop Shadow and Glow sit behind the frame. Border packs replace the plain border with animated ones such as Sweep Border, Circuit Border, Pulse Border, RGB Cycle, Gradient Border, and Marching Ants, and effect packs such as Duotone, Fireflies, Focus Fade, Mosaic, and Rain on Glass tint or texture the window. A window uses either the plain border setting or a decoration pack, and any layer of a pack can be turned off on its own. Per-window and per-context overrides are ordinary rules ([#624](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/624), [#757](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/757), [#762](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/762), [#764](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/764), [#768](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/768), [#770](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/770)).
- **Audio-reactive window decorations**: the Audio Border pack drives its border from the audio spectrum through the same CAVA capture the shaders use, and the compositor animation shaders can read the spectrum as well. The full CAVA parameter set is now editable in settings, covering the bar count, smoothing, noise reduction, frequency range, and channel handling ([#624](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/624), [#752](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/752), [#763](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/763)).
- **Virtual desktop switch animations**: switching virtual desktops can now play a full-screen transition. Turn it on for the new desktop switch event on the Animations → Transitions → Desktop page and pick a pack. Eleven packs ship with it, including Desktop Fade, Desktop Slide, Desktop Wipe, Desktop Cube, and Desktop Dissolve, and the motion follows the direction you switch. It is off by default ([#747](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/747)).
- **Set window layer, a new rule action**: a rule can keep a matched window above or below other windows, in the spirit of Krohnkite's layers, and PlasmaZones puts the layer back the way it was when the rule stops matching ([#759](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/759)).
- **Per-context autotile rule actions**: Set algorithm parameter, Set insert position, Set overflow behavior, and Set drag behavior, together with per-context overrides for the maximum window count, split ratio, and master count. A screen, virtual desktop, or activity can tune its tiling without moving the global default ([#733](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/733)).
- **New match conditions for rules**: Tiled window count matches on how many windows are currently tiled, so a rule can switch algorithm as the count grows ([#703](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/703)), and Active layout scopes a rule to the layout in use ([#733](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/733)).
- **Centered, a single-window layout**: a bundled algorithm that holds the focused window centered at a width you set and keeps the rest behind it, built on new support for single-window layouts in scripts ([#703](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/703)).
- **Back and forward navigation in settings**: the settings app remembers the pages you visit, so you can step back to where you were and forward again from the breadcrumb row ([#749](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/749)).
- **Randomize and reset for algorithm and shader parameters**: the parameter editor gains a randomize control on each parameter and a button to randomize or reset a whole group at once, which makes it quick to explore how a shader or algorithm's settings look ([#737](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/737)).
- **Discord community link**: the Links card on the About page now has a Discord Community button that opens the project's invite.

### Changed

- **The Rules page is one flat priority list**: rules show in a single, drag-reorderable list ordered by precedence, with the highest-priority rule on top, instead of per-section groups. Drag any rule up or down to set which one wins. The filter button narrows the list by source (system or user-created), category, and status. Search and the monitor strip narrow it further ([#720](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/720)).
- **"Window Rules" is now "Rules"**: the page and the config file (`windowrules.json` becomes `rules.json`) are renamed, because rules now cover gaps, layout, and animation as well as windows. Existing rules carry over automatically ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **Window Appearance and Animations are grouped under an Appearance category** in the settings sidebar ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **Gaps use one shared model**: snapping zone padding and tiling inner gap are now the same setting. Set per-monitor gaps on the Appearance Windows page where a monitor should differ ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **The action and condition pickers are reorganized**: both are alphabetized, and the action picker groups the context conditions above the window conditions with a divider ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699)).
- **Old per-mode appearance and gap settings are unified on upgrade**: the snapping and tiling border, title bar, and gap values you had customized collapse into shared Window and Gap settings, and per-monitor gaps move into per-monitor settings. A default configuration is unchanged ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699), [#730](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/730)).
- **Dragging a window is its own animation page**: drag animations are physics driven and follow the pointer while you hold the window, so they use their own shader type instead of the crossfade shaders. The new Window Dragging page under Animations → Motion holds the event, its picker offers only drag shaders such as Wobbly Move, and it no longer takes the "All Windows" shader from the Window Motion page. If you had Wobbly Move set on "All Windows", pick it again on the new page ([#756](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/756)).
- **Layout and zone names are limited to 40 characters everywhere**: the zone editor previously allowed zone names up to 100 characters, and names arriving over D-Bus or from imported files were not limited at all. An existing name that is longer keeps working and is shortened the next time the layout is saved ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Layouts that opt out of minimum window sizes are now left alone**: Tatami, Floating Center, Cluster, and Theater each declare that they do not work with minimum window sizes, but the correction pass ran over their zones anyway and reshaped them. Zones from a layout that opts out are now used as the layout produced them. If a window in one of these four had been nudged to meet its minimum size, it keeps the size the layout gives it instead ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Zone numbers are yours to set**: the number shown on a zone in the editor is now a value the zone carries rather than its position in the list, so reordering or editing the zones no longer renumbers them ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Floating windows restore across monitors**: a window you float and then close now reopens on the monitor and position it closed on when you log back in, the same as snapped windows already did. A guard that limited this to a single monitor was removed ([#727](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/727)).

### Removed

- **The Resized animation event**: an interactive resize repaints the window live while you drag its edge, so there is no before and after moment for an animation to play. The event showed a default that never ran and did nothing useful when configured. Size changes from snapping, layout switches, and maximizing keep their animations through those events ([#756](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/756)).

### Migration

- **Config schema bumped v4 → v5.** On first launch after upgrade, the per-mode border, title bar, corner radius, and gap values are converted into rules, and per-monitor gaps become screen-scoped rules. The conversion runs once, keeps the values you had customized, and needs no interaction ([#699](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/699), [#730](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/730), [#733](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/733)).

### Fixed

- **Creating an algorithm from a template keeps its behavior intact**: the New Algorithm wizard used to rewrite a template's metadata from the wizard's own four checkboxes, which silently dropped settings that shape how the template behaves, such as the template's own custom parameters, split ratio, and window cap. Only the name and id are personalized now, and the rest of the metadata travels with the copy, which is what lets the wizard offer the newer templates safely ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Double-clicking Create in the New Layout wizard made two layouts**: the Create button stayed live through the dialog's closing animation, so a second click, or holding Return, landed a second layout you then had to delete. The wizard now ignores anything after the first Create, and re-enables it if the create fails so you can correct the name and retry ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **The New Layout wizard tagged layouts with the wrong monitor shape**: every choice in the monitor picker stored the shape one step below the one you picked, so a 16:9 layout was filed as suiting any monitor, a 21:9 layout was filed as 16:9, and a Portrait layout was filed as 32:9. Portrait could not be stored at all. The picker now records the shape you chose, and its first option is named "Any" rather than "Auto" because it always meant "offered on every monitor" and never read a monitor to detect anything ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Some settings and editor animations ignored your animation speed**: the hover feedback in the position picker and the settings button groups, the sidebar rows, the wizard template cards, the page fade-in, and the zone editor's own transitions (its top bar, property panel, notification banner, divider handles, zones, and zone buttons) ran at fixed durations, so turning Plasma's animation speed up or down left them alone while the rest of the app followed it. They now read the same theme duration everything else does. At the default speed they keep the timing they have today, so nothing looks different until you ask it to ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Exporting your settings over the file they live in deleted them**: the export made room for the new file by removing whatever was already at the destination, so picking your own `config.json` removed the very file it was about to copy, and every setting you had was gone with no backup to fall back on. The message blamed the folder for not being writable. Exporting to the file already in use is now refused, and the export no longer clears the destination at all. It writes to a temporary file and swaps it in only once the write has succeeded, so an export that fails leaves whatever was already there untouched. Importing a file onto itself is refused the same way instead of reporting a failure for what is really a no-op ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Exporting or importing a layout said nothing when it failed**: exporting sent the layout off to the daemon and never waited to hear back, so a folder it could not write to, or a disk with no room left, closed the file picker and told you nothing. Importing a file that was not a layout was just as quiet: the page refreshed and you were left to notice that nothing had arrived. Both now say what went wrong, and the export writes to a temporary file and swaps it in only once it has succeeded, so a failed export leaves whatever was already there untouched ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Exporting your settings saved them as well**: Export wrote your unsaved changes into the settings file the app is using, as though you had pressed Save, and moved the point that Discard reverts to. Edits you had not committed became permanent and there was no longer anything to undo them back to. Exporting now writes the settings you can see to the file you picked and leaves the live one alone ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Exporting or importing your settings said nothing at all**: the file picker closed and you were left to guess whether it had worked, or whether it had failed on a path it would not write to, a file that was not a settings file, or a backup it could not take. Both now confirm when they succeed and say what went wrong when they don't. If an import lands but the animation pages cannot be refreshed to match, it now says so rather than reporting plain success, and if your old settings cannot be put back after a failed import it tells you where the backup is ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Turning animations off made some of them play at full length**: with Plasma's animation speed at zero, the animations that scale from the shorter theme durations asked for a zero-length animation, which was read as "no duration set" and fell back to the animation's own full duration. So the setting meant to remove animation gave those the longest one they had. Zero now means zero, and the affected animations are instant as intended ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **Importing an algorithm reported the same failure twice**: a refused file toasted both the specific reason and a generic "could not import" behind it. Only the reason shows now ([#779](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/779)).
- **The zone picker did not show which zone a window would snap to**: while dragging a window, every zone in a layout lit up at once instead of only the one under the cursor, so there was no way to tell where the window would land. Only the zone under the cursor highlights now. The cursor also lands on the right zone more reliably, because the picker used to measure zones against the whole card rather than the smaller preview it draws inside it. That was off by a few pixels for most layouts, and by considerably more for a layout tagged with an aspect ratio that does not match the shape of the preview, such as an ultrawide layout shown in a 16:9 preview ([#780](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/780)).
- **Minimizing a window skipped its animation**: the Minimized animation event used to fire only when a window was restored, so the way down was always an instant blink. Any animation assigned to the event now plays in both directions, in reverse while minimizing and forward while restoring. Windows excluded from tiling also play their minimize animation now, matching how the other window events already treated them ([#776](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/776)).
- **Peek at Desktop did nothing while the effect was loaded**: activating Peek at Desktop left every window exactly where it was. KDE reveals the desktop through its Window Aperture effect, which keeps windows on screen and slides them out to the screen edges, and the PlasmaZones effect ended each window's paint step by jumping straight to the draw stage. That skipped the paint step of every effect that runs after PlasmaZones in KWin's chain, so Window Aperture held the windows visible but never got to move them. The effect now continues the paint chain properly, which also restores any other effect that paints after PlasmaZones in KWin's chain. Decorated windows additionally honor opacity fades from other effects instead of always drawing fully opaque, and focus follows mouse pauses during a peek so the hidden window under the cursor is not re-activated ([#775](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/775)).
- **Dragging a window stuttered at the start and end of the drag on disks with slow write flushing**: the daemon bound a temporary global Escape shortcut on every drag and released it on drop, and each bind made KWin rewrite its shortcut config to disk with an fsync. On a drive with slow flush latency that briefly stalled the compositor at pickup and at drop, while a continuous drag stayed smooth. The per-drag binding is gone, because the KWin effect already grabs Escape for the whole drag, so dragging is smooth regardless of disk. Thanks @arinl for the report and the bpftrace diagnosis ([#714](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/714), [discussion #167](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/167)).
- **Maximize and restore animations never played**: maximizing a window with an animation assigned made it vanish for the length of the animation and pop in at full size, and restoring played the wrong motion with every pack except Window morph. The maximize event never told the animation which rectangles it was moving between, and the restore leg ran the timeline backwards for the grid-deformation packs. Both directions now morph between the old and new frame with any geometry pack. Restore also waits for the window's real size change before starting, so an app that is slow to shrink no longer snaps first and animates late, and dragging a maximized window free by its title bar no longer fires a stray maximize animation over the drag ([#755](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/755)).
- **"Move Window Left" skipped through overlapping zones**: in a layout where zones overlap each other, moving a window left jumped straight to the leftmost zone in one keypress, while moving right stepped one zone at a time. The zone picker broke ties between overlapping zones by their storage order, which only happened to match the expected zone when moving right. Ties now break by distance, so moving, focusing, and swapping a window all step to the nearest zone in every direction. Thanks @Nathorr for the report ([#773](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/773), [discussion #771](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/771)).

## [3.1.3] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **Rebuilt for KWin 6.1.2**: the PlasmaZones KWin effect is compiled against a specific KWin version and will not load under a different one, so this release rebuilds the effect for KWin 6.1.2. Update to it once your system moves to that KWin, otherwise window dragging, shortcuts, and snapping stop working.
- **Shorter KWin version-mismatch warning**: when the installed effect was built for a different KWin than the one running, the notification now gives just the diagnosis and the rebuild-and-reinstall fix, without the NixOS-specific install note.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **A "Default / Any window" layout rule was ignored**: a per-context rule that set the engine or snapping layout for any window did nothing, so a virtual desktop with no specific assignment fell through to the global default (for example BSP) instead of the configured layout. A layout-only rule (a snapping layout or tiling algorithm with no engine set) was dropped the same way. Per-context rules now resolve each slot on its own, so the catch-all rule applies as the default and a layout-only rule fills its slot without forcing the engine ([#698](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/698)).
- **Editor zone edits were lost when the geometry snapped back**: dragging or resizing a zone updated it on screen, but the change was never written to the layout or shown in the properties panel when the committed geometry rounded back to roughly its original spot. The visual is now reconciled with the saved geometry whenever an operation ends ([#697](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/697), [discussion #696](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/696)).

## [3.1.1] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Route a window to a monitor or virtual desktop**: two new window-rule actions, RouteToScreen and RouteToDesktop, open a matched window on a specific monitor or virtual desktop (or both) and can snap it into a zone there. On its own a rule can just move the window to that monitor. This restores the per-monitor app-to-zone assignment from v3 and generalizes it to "open app X on context Y" for both snapping and tiling ([#691](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/691)).
- **Autotile capability badges in layout previews**: the shared preview cards used by the overlay picker, the zone selector, and the settings layout surfaces now show the autotile capability badges, matching the Layouts page ([#688](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/688)).

### Changed

- **Curated default layout and algorithm visibility on fresh installs**: the plain `grid` autotile algorithm is hidden by default because the resize-aware `aligned-grid` supersedes it, and the `Wide` snapping layout is now shown by default. This only seeds on a fresh config, so existing users keep their current visibility ([#687](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/687)).

### Removed

- **The "is one of" match operator**: this window-rule match operator was unusable in the editor and has been removed ([#691](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/691)).

### Fixed

- **Autotiling failed to load any algorithm in non-C locales**: scripted algorithms compile through Luau, which parsed numbers with the system locale, so a regional locale with a decimal comma broke every algorithm, including the shared prelude, and the UI reported "No autotile algorithms available". LC_NUMERIC is now pinned to "C" while Luau compiles and runs ([#692](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/692), [discussion #690](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/690)).
- **Per-monitor app assignments stopped working after upgrading from v3**: the v3 to v4 migration dropped the legacy per-monitor `targetScreen` pin and left X11 two-token patterns (`chromium chromium`) that never matched the normalized app id. The migration now carries the pin across as a RouteToScreen action and normalizes the pattern ([#691](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/691), [discussion #686](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/686)).
- **Quick Shortcuts applied the wrong layout**: `Meta+Alt+#` applied whatever layout sat at that position in Priority order instead of the layout bound to that quick slot ([#684](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/684)).
- **Windows landed in the wrong zones during fast rotation**: holding the rotate shortcut applied superseded geometry updates after the daemon had already moved on, so windows ended up in stale zones. The effect now drops superseded geometry ticks ([#689](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/689)).
- **`restoreWindowsToZonesOnLogin` did nothing**: the toggle round-tripped through config, D-Bus, and the UI but its value was never read, so a window snapped at logout always restored to its zone. It is now honored on login ([#685](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/685)).
- **Per-context gap and padding overrides were ignored for tiled windows**: window-rule gap overrides applied only to snapped windows, not autotiled ones. They now apply to both ([#685](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/685)).
- **Snapping ignored some window-rule exclusions**: window-class, title, and minimum-size exclusion conditions were not honored on the snapping path. The full window query is now consulted ([#685](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/685)).
- **Layout names were blank in the overlay previews**: the picker, OSD, and zone-selector preview cards read the old `name` key instead of `displayName`, so the name label rendered empty. They now read `displayName` ([#688](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/688)).
- **The layout dropdown highlight washed out the badges**: the layout combo box highlighted the active row with a full opaque band that left the category, capability, and aspect-ratio badges illegible. It now uses the same subtle tint as the rest of the app ([#693](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/693)).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Rules**: a new unified settings page replaces the old Snapping Assignments, Tiling Assignments, Animations App Rules, and per-mode "disabled apps" lists. Rules are browsed, added, edited, drag-reordered, duplicated, and disabled from one place. Matching composes class, title, role, app-id, virtual desktop, activity, and screen predicates with AND/OR/NOT. A rule's actions cover snapping/tiling assignment, animation-curve and shader overrides, and exclusion from snapping, autotile, and effects, the four surfaces that previously each had their own editor.
- **`org.plasmazones.Rules` D-Bus interface** (`dbus/org.plasmazones.Rules.xml`): `getAllRules`, `setAllRules`, `addRule`, `removeRule`, and related lifecycle methods for programmatic rule management.
- **`phosphor-rules`** LGPL-2.1+ library housing the rule model, parser, and `RuleEvaluator`, so third parties can link the matcher without inheriting GPL.
- **Snapping focus behavior**: two new opt-in toggles on Snapping → Window → Behavior (both default off). *focus new windows* auto-activates a window when it is auto-placed into a zone on open, and *focus follows mouse* activates the snapped window under the cursor. Brings snapping to parity with the existing autotile focus options.
- **Zone span toggle mode** ([#563](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/563)): an opt-in switch in the Zone Span card so the span modifier can be tapped to start/stop spanning instead of held down for the whole drag (default off, motivated by accessibility).
- **Restore floated window positions on login** ([#606](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/606)): floated windows are now restored to the monitor and position they closed on after a KWin session restore (previously only *snapped* windows were restored cross-screen). Parallel per-engine toggles (both default **on**), *restore unsnapped windows* under Snapping → Window → Behavior and *restore untiled windows* under Tiling → Behavior, plus an engine-neutral per-window `RestorePosition` rule action let specific windows opt in or out for either mode.
- **Per-window appearance for snapping**: snapping gains its own border, corner-radius, hide-title-bar, and accent-color settings, mirroring tiling, and the former "Snapping → Appearance" page is renamed **Zones**. Window restore state across daemon restart and logout/login is now backed by a single `WindowPlacementStore` instead of several overlapping mechanisms.
- **New window-rule actions** for window chrome: per-window border, title-bar, corner-radius, accent-color, gap/padding, and opacity overrides, applied to snapped or floating windows (e.g. "floating windows on monitor 2 → no title bar + red border", "activity Gaming → zero gaps").
- **New window-rule match conditions**: `IsTransient`, `IsNotification`, `Width`, `Height`, and `IsFocused`, plus a built-in **"Don't animate small windows"** template. `IsFocused` lets any action be focus-scoped (e.g. "WHEN NOT focused → dim").
- **Collapsible settings sidebar categories** with smart-expand of the active page's category and animated chevrons, cutting clicks to reach deep pages.
- **Per-monitor scope map**: per-monitor settings cards carry a scope chip that opens a spatial map of the real monitor arrangement to switch outputs, replacing the tall repeated monitor-selector block. The scope choice persists across pages.
- **Shader-driven window-move/resize morph** (`window-morph`): window move, resize, snap, and layout-switch transitions animate as a smooth shader cross-fade geometry morph instead of a plain C++ paint transform, the default for window-move and overridable per event. Overlay show/hide (OSD, zone selector, layout picker, snap assist) now defaults to the shader-based `fade` effect.
- **In-app live shader preview**: the Snapping → Shaders browser gains an animated, interactive preview with mouse and audio input, shader **presets** (load/save, shared with the editor), and an in-app compile-error banner.
- **Shader authoring API**: authors write only the effect body and read parameters by name (`p_<id>`) instead of decoding UBO slots, with a generated preamble and entry-point conventions, plus a `plasmazones-shader-validate` CLI (with `--animation` / `--overlay` modes and did-you-mean diagnostics) wired into CI to catch broken packs offline.
- **dma-buf zero-copy window-preview transport** for snap-assist thumbnails (opt-in via the `PLASMAZONES_DMABUF_THUMBNAILS` env var, with default builds unchanged), the foundation for live window previews.
- **Phosphor SDK groundwork**: the reusable LGPL Phosphor library line gains a Phase 1 foundation tier (`phosphor-theme`, `phosphor-popout`, `phosphor-registry`, `phosphor-ipc` + the `phosphorctl` driver, `phosphor-shell` per-screen helper) and a Phase 2 system-service tier (`phosphor-service-{pipewire,network,bluetooth,brightness,notifications,polkit,idle,clipboard,lock,session,upower,mpris,icontheme,sni}`). All of it is gated behind `BUILD_PHOSPHOR_SHELL` (default off) and driveable only from standalone examples/CLIs. It is groundwork for the standalone Phosphor shell direction and is **not** part of the shipping PlasmaZones tiler.
- **Resize-aware tiling** ([#666](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/666)): six split-ratio algorithms (master-stack, wide, focus-sidebar, zen, deck, and horizontal-deck) now reflow on interactive resize. Dragging the master or boundary edge updates the split ratio for that desktop the same way a master-ratio keystroke does, without bleeding into other screens or the global default. The Layouts page shows a per-algorithm **Reflows** badge and can group algorithms by it.
- **Suppress default layout assignment** ([#676](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/676)): a new setting, with a matching `DefaultLayoutAssignment` window-rule action, stops a context from falling back to the synthesized default layout. A suppressed context shows no snapping overlay or zone selector, reports no layout, and shows a "No layout assigned" OSD. Switching it into autotile sets the mode without applying the global default algorithm until a concrete one is assigned.
- **Layouts page rebuilt** as a searchable, card-based catalogue with collapsible capability groups, per-layout deep links, and global-search reveal, matching the shader browser and Rules. Tiling algorithms expose a **Script State** capability (filter, group-by, and a card badge) alongside the reflow and persistent-memory badges, layout and algorithm cards show their description on hover, and bundled snapping layouts open in a text editor.

### Changed

- **Single rule format**: window assignments, per-mode disable lists, animation App Rules, and effect exclusion lists are unified into one rule list stored in `~/.config/plasmazones/rules.json`. The KWin effect now consults the same `RuleEvaluator` as the daemon for animation App-Rule resolution and exclusion checks, so the two cannot drift.
- **`LayoutRegistry::walkCascade` removed**, replaced by `RuleEvaluator`. The old per-axis cascade (context-keyed assignments vs window-property matching) no longer exists. All matching goes through the evaluator.
- **`org.plasmazones.WindowTracking.setWindowMetadata`** widened from 4 to 9 arguments to carry the additional fields the evaluator needs (role, app-id, desktop, activity, screen). The KWin effect and daemon must be installed and running as a matched pair. `MinPeerApiVersion` bumped 3 → 4, and either side refuses to register a mismatched peer rather than silently degrading. Packagers must rebuild and ship both binaries together.
- **`org.plasmazones.Layout.assignmentChangesApplied`** signal dropped its second argument (the per-key field tag). Subscribers that depended on that field must update or they will receive the wrong arity.
- **Scripted autotiling moved from QJSEngine (JavaScript) to an embedded, sandboxed Luau VM** (`phosphor-scripting`). The 25 bundled algorithms were ported `*.js` → `*.luau`, written against a new frozen `pz` standard library, with a per-engine CPU-time watchdog and a 64 MiB heap cap. The `TilingAlgorithm` contract, daemon, editor, and settings are unchanged. **Breaking for custom algorithms**: the loader now discovers only `*.luau` files, so user scripts in `~/.local/share/plasmazones/algorithms/` written in the old JavaScript form are no longer loaded and must be rewritten in Luau (see `docs/architecture/luau-algorithm-authoring.md`).
- **Snapping and Tiling settings aligned for parity.** Tiling gains a dedicated Focus card. Section and label naming is unified across both modes ("Inner gap" / "Outer gap", "Window Handling", parallel quick-shortcut labels), and the placement settings are reorganized into a consistent Overlay / Window / Configuration shape with gaps moved into Window → Appearance and per-monitor gap selectors. User settings are preserved (C++ symbol renames only).
- **Performance.** Daemon peak heap is down ~58% (149 → 63 MB) and idle CPU drops from ~25% to ~0. The overlay and snap-assist release their full-screen image buffers when dismissed (≈33 MB per shader-enabled 4K screen, ≈6 MB of thumbnail cache), and a content-addressed on-disk shader cache speeds warm launches. Settings pages that were slow on first visit now open fast via a page-instance cache, background compile-warming, and viewport virtualization of the animation-event card lists.
- **Settings app rebuilt on the reusable `phosphor-control` library** (extracted from the in-app settings chrome, formerly named `phosphor-settings-ui`), reducing the app to a thin consumer with visual parity.
- **Internal `pz` → `p` symbol-prefix debrand** across shader params, classes, macros, CMake helpers, and the Luau tiling global (`pz` → `phosphor_luau`). The user-facing `PlasmaZones` brand and the global-shortcut ID namespace are deliberately unchanged. All ad-hoc registries (shaders, animation, curves, tiles algorithms, layout sources) are unified onto a single thread-safe `Registry<T>` primitive with public APIs preserved.
- **Nix flake restructured around a single package definition.** The 312-line `flake.nix` is now thin wiring, and the build recipe and the KWin-IID rationale live in `packaging/nix/{package,overlays,module,hm-module,devShell,formatter}.nix`. The package is defined once in `overlays.nix` (`final.callPackage`) and every output (`packages`, `devShells`, `checks`, `formatter`) derives from `legacyPackages.<system>.extend overlay`, replacing five independent build call sites that each had to remember to build against the right pkgs. The version is parsed once from the top-level `project(PlasmaZones VERSION …)` in `CMakeLists.txt` inside `flake.nix` (where the flake `self` is a store path, so the read is pure) and threaded to the package as an argument. Reading it inside `package.nix` forced an import-from-derivation when nixpkgs builds from a `fetchFromGitHub` src. LTO is now opt-in (`enableLTO`, default off) instead of forced, since every module/overlay consumer rebuilds against host pkgs with no cache reuse. The build source is `lib.fileset`-scoped so editing docs/CI/flake files no longer invalidates it. `nix fmt` now formats Nix, C++, and QML (reusing the in-tree `.clang-format`), and the NixOS module declares the `plasmazones` systemd user service with autostart opt-in (default off, preserving the per-user "enable it yourself" policy).
- **Autotiling is on by default** ([#671](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/671)): tiling now works out of the box so PlasmaZones behaves like a dynamic tiler with no setup. The companion behaviors (focus new windows, smart gaps, respect minimum size, exclude transient windows, and insert at the stack end) were already on by default, and the default algorithm (bsp) and gaps are unchanged. Only fresh installs are affected, and existing saved configs keep their current value.
- **Settings UI polish** across the Layouts and listing pages: a curated default picker shows a starter set of layouts and algorithms with the rest one eye-toggle away, a shared filter menu now drives the Layouts, Rules, and Shaders lists, and the sidebar, global search field, About credits, and virtual-screen preview labels got alignment and spacing fixes.

### Removed

- Legacy `Display.SnappingDisabled*` and `Display.AutotileDisabled*` config keys (auto-migrated into rules).
- **QJSEngine-based scripted-tiling path** (the `ScriptedAlgorithm` runtime, its JS builtins, and the bundled `*.js` algorithms), along with the `Qt6::Qml` dependency in `phosphor-tiles`. Replaced by the Luau path above.
- `setSnappingLayoutEntry`, `setTilingAlgorithmEntry`, and related per-field `Settings`-side `Q_INVOKABLE`s that the legacy KCM Assignments pages used. There is no QML replacement. Use the Rules page.
- Legacy Snapping Assignments, Tiling Assignments, and Animations App Rules settings pages (replaced by Rules).
- **Per-release `plasmazones.nix` asset and its `generate-release-nix.sh` generator.** The asset was a source-pinned build *recipe* (not a binary), so it saved no build time and only served non-flake Nix users, who can instead build any tag against their host's pkgs with `pkgs.callPackage "${builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/archive/v<VERSION>.tar.gz"}/packaging/nix/package.nix" { version = "<VERSION>"; }`. The release notes' standalone-install section now shows that form, and the `build-nix` release job is reduced to a `nix build` smoke gate. Flake users are unaffected.
- **Stray `develop.nix`**: an unrelated dev flake (for "canaanepperson.com", `nodejs_24`) that had no connection to PlasmaZones. The dev environment lives in the flake's `devShells.default`.

### Migration

- **Config schema bumped v3 → v4.** On first launch after upgrade, `~/.config/plasmazones/assignments.json` is automatically converted into `~/.config/plasmazones/rules.json`, and the legacy `Display.SnappingDisabled*` / `Display.AutotileDisabled*` keys in `config.json` are folded into the same rule set. The migration is lossless and runs without user interaction.
- **Backout**: the source file is renamed `assignments.json.migrated` (not deleted), so a downgrade can restore the previous schema by manually renaming it back and starting an older daemon.
- **Recovery**: if migration aborts because the source is malformed, the original file is renamed to `~/.config/plasmazones/assignments.json.corrupt.bak`, the schema version stays at v3, and `rules.json` is not created. The daemon does not silently flush the old assignments to an empty rule set. The user can inspect / repair the quarantined file and rename it back to `assignments.json`, and the next launch then retries the v3→v4 conversion.
- **`hiddenFromSelector` now relocates out of layout files** during the v3→v4 layout-settings conversion. A v3 user who hid a layout previously kept the key embedded in the slimmed layout file instead of having it moved to the `layout-settings.json` sidecar. The migration now carries it across with the other relocated keys. Autotile per-algorithm overrides also fold into `layout-settings.json`, and the standalone `autotile-overrides.json` is retired by a one-time self-deleting migration on load.

### Fixed

- **Layouts rendered stretched / ultrawide when editing on a 16:9 or 4K screen** ([#593](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/593)): the editor canvas used a fixed-zone bounding box as its aspect reference, so editing an existing layout could distort it while creating a new one rendered correctly. The canvas now references the live screen unless fixed zones genuinely overflow it.
- **A zone-spanning window blew up to fullscreen when switching layouts** ([#575](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/575)): switching to a layout where the previously-spanned zones are non-contiguous (e.g. Grid 2×2 left column → Master+Stack) unioned them into a screen-sized bounding box. Non-contiguous mapped spans now collapse to the primary zone instead.
- **KWin effect plugin silently never installed under Nix.** `packaging/nix/package.nix` set `KDE_INSTALL_QTPLUGINDIR` to an absolute path *inside the read-only `qtbase` store output* (`${qt6.qtbase}/lib/qt6/plugins`). A derivation may only write under its own `$out`, so the effect dropped out of the package closure entirely. The daemon ran but zone overlays never appeared on Nix installs. The plugin now installs into the package's own `$out/${qt6.qtbase.qtPluginPrefix}` (the canonical NixOS `lib/qt-6/plugins` layout), where the running KWin discovers it via the system profile's aggregated `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`.
- **Toggling from autotile back to snapping left windows stuck in their tiled positions** instead of returning to where they were before tiling. The transition fell through to a stale current-assignment resnap that re-pinned the tiled geometry and suppressed the float-back. Windows now float back to their pre-tile positions.
- **Master-ratio and master-count adjustments bled into the global default** ([#666](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/666)): the increase/decrease ratio and master-count shortcuts wrote the new value into the global config whenever a screen had no per-screen override, so the tweak propagated to sibling screens and new states on the next algorithm switch or settings refresh. The adjustment now stays local to the active screen, desktop, and activity, and resets only on an algorithm switch or an explicit ratio/count change in settings.

## [3.0.17] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **PlasmaZones held back KWin upgrades, stranding Plasma in a half-upgraded state**: the native packages pinned KWin to the *exact* version PlasmaZones was built against (to guarantee the KWin effect plugin's IID matched the running KWin). On distros that ship KWin and PlasmaZones from separate repos (e.g. Fedora KWin from the distro, PlasmaZones from COPR), a newer KWin landing before a matching PlasmaZones rebuild could not satisfy the exact pin, so the package manager held KWin back. That left KWin out of sync with the rest of Plasma, which surfaced as "No KScreen backend found" and, at worst, a black screen at login (reported on Fedora 44 / Plasma 6.7). The runtime dependency is now a minimum (`kwin >= 6.7.0`) across the RPM, Debian, and Arch (source/bin/git) packages instead of an exact pin, so a newer KWin no longer blocks the upgrade. A mismatched effect is harmless. KWin reads the IID from plugin metadata and never loads a non-matching effect, so the plugin stays inert and only the drag overlay is missing until PlasmaZones is rebuilt. Core tiling (daemon and layer-shell QPA plugin) is unaffected. Nix is unchanged, because it has no install-time pin and rebuilds the whole system, so it cannot strand the desktop.

## [3.0.16] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Support KDE Plasma 6.7** ([#638](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/638)): the build baseline moves to the Plasma 6.7 stack (KDE Frameworks 6.26, Qt 6.10, and KWin 6.7), and the KWin C++ effect is ported to the 6.7 effect API. Notable upstream changes were handled. `prePaintScreen`/`prePaintWindow` dropped their `presentTime` argument (the effect now self-sources frame time from a steady clock, matching KWin's own effects), `EffectWindow::frameGeometry()` and `EffectsHandler::clientArea()` now return `KWin::RectF`, the `clientArea` per-desktop overload was removed, `addRepaint()` gained `RectF`/`Rect`/`Region` overloads, and `GLShader::isValid()` was removed. Plasma 6.6 is no longer supported.

### Fixed

- **Snap-assist window thumbnails on Plasma 6.7** ([#638](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/638)): KWin 6.7 removed the offscreen-QML readback (`OffscreenQuickView::bufferAsImage()`) that the in-process thumbnail capture relied on. Capture was reworked to render each candidate window into an offscreen `GLFramebuffer` via `effects->drawWindow()` and read it back with `GLTexture::toImage()`, so snap-assist thumbnails keep working without a second screenshot round-trip.

## [3.0.15] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **Zone-selector popup at the screen edge switched the active layout on hover, resnapping every tiled window** ([#542](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/542)): the zone-selector slot was supposed to be input-transparent during drag, because cursor coordinates come in via the D-Bus `updateSelectorPosition` path and the snap commits at drag-end via `drop.cpp`, never via a Qt hover event. But the slot's QML `MouseArea`s still fired `zoneSelected` on every pointer-enter, and once snap-assist became visible the shared shell surface flipped to input-grabbing (`anyInputGrabbing = isVisible(snapAssistSlot) || isVisible(layoutPickerSlot)` in `syncPassiveShellSurfaceState`). Those leaked hover events committed `manualLayoutSelected`, which immediately resnapped every other tiled window into the new layout's zones. Visible as "my layout changes to one with more or fewer windows whenever I drag windows up". The QML hover commit path is gone (`ZoneSelectorContent` is now `interactive: false` and the daemon's `manualLayoutSelected` handler / signal are removed), and cross-layout switching on drop still works because `WindowDragAdaptor::dragStopped` reads `m_selectedLayoutId` from the C++ hit-test and applies the layout when the user actually releases the drag on a zone in a different layout.

### Removed

- **Switching the autotile algorithm by hovering an autotile preview in the zone-selector popup** ([#542](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/542)): the autotile-hover commit path went away with the input-contract fix above (`drop.cpp` resolves the selected id as a UUID and skips non-UUID autotile ids, so the hover path was the only commit point for autotile-via-zone-selector). Algorithm swaps still work through the existing on-by-default routes such as `NextLayout` / `PreviousLayout`, `QuickLayout1`–`QuickLayout9`, and the Layout Picker (`Meta+Alt+Space` by default). The `IOverlayService::autotileLayoutSelected` signal and its daemon handler were removed as dead code.

## [3.0.14] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **DPMS-wake autotile orphan reassignment still triggered intermittently** ([#527](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/527), [#536](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/536)): 3.0.13 closed the dropped-monitor case but missed the dual-monitor wake-up where the second output coming back simply shifts the first output's x-offset. With no output actually removed, `oldScreenStillConnected` stayed true, and `isScreenChangeInProgress()` hadn't flipped on yet because KWin emits the per-window `outputChanged` *before* the `virtualScreenGeometryChanged` that the screen-change debounce listens for, so the orphan reached the autotile-delegation guard with both legs of the check false. `screenAdded` and `screenRemoved` are now also wired into the screen-change handler, latching the pending-change flag at the earliest point KWin tells us the output set is changing. The settle path that runs once `virtualScreenGeometryChanged` catches up is unchanged.

## [3.0.13] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Windows from disabled monitors got pulled into the active autotile zone after DPMS sleep** ([#527](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/527), [#528](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/528)): with one monitor autotile-disabled, waiting for that monitor to power off and then moving the mouse to wake the active monitor would cause windows from the disabled monitor to be tiled into the active zone. KWin reassigns orphaned windows from a dropped-out monitor to a remaining output and fires `outputChanged` for each, indistinguishable from a deliberate cross-screen move. The snapping D-Bus path already guarded for this with `oldScreenStillConnected && !isScreenChangeInProgress()`, but the autotile delegation immediately above ran unconditionally, so the orphan reassignment was mistaken for the window genuinely entering autotile. The disconnect check now feeds both paths via a shared `involuntaryMove` flag, and recovery is owned by the daemon's `virtualScreensReconfigured` handler once the screen change has stopped chattering.

## [3.0.12] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **Focus-follows-mouse stole focus from active floating and overflow windows** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#525](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/525)): the 3.0.11 FFM pause fixed the case where an excluded window (emoji picker, notification popup, krunner) was active, but the symmetric case for floating windows still regressed. A manually-floated window, or an overflow window the daemon auto-floats when window count exceeds the `maxWindows` cap, sits on top of the tiled stack while the user works in it. Moving the cursor across an underlying tiled window's visible edge still activated that tiled window and sent the floating one to the background. `handleCursorMoved`'s active-window guard now also bails when `isWindowFloating()` returns true for the focused window. `FloatingCache` covers both code paths (user-toggled float and overflow auto-float via `applyFloatCleanup`), so one predicate handles both scenarios. Resumes naturally on the next cursor move once a tiled window becomes active.

## [3.0.11] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Layer-shell state setters skip unchanged values across configure events** ([#522](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/522)): KWin re-emits `zwlr_layer_surface_v1` configure events on every virtual-desktop switch, and `applyProperties` was unconditionally re-sending the full layer-shell state (anchor, layer, exclusive zone, keyboard interactivity, margin, size, exclusive edge), which is six to seven protocol messages per surface per configure. The applied state is now cached per surface and each setter only fires when its source property has actually changed.

### Fixed

- **Focus-follows-mouse activated tiled windows underneath an active popup** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#521](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/521)): the 3.0.10 FFM fix made auto-focus-follow-mouse consistent for the common case but missed the case where an excluded or untracked window (emoji picker, notification popup, krunner) was active inside a zone. Moving the cursor across the underlying tiled window's visible area still activated that tiled window, sending the just-opened popup straight to the background. `handleCursorMoved` now also checks the currently active window. If it is an excluded app, dialog, popup, keep-above overlay, or below the min-size threshold, FFM pauses on the cursor's screen until a tileable window becomes active.
- **Stale pending-restore entries for excluded apps grew session.json and logged on every daemon start** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#521](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/521)): runtime gates already refused to honor pending restores for excluded apps, but the dead entries persisted on disk in `PendingRestoreQueues` and `AutotilePendingRestores` and reappeared on every restart. Both engines now prune their on-disk queues against the current exclusion lists at startup and whenever the lists change.
- **Drag artifacts, post-snap flicker, and a gray decoration ring during snap drags** ([#523](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/523)): the zone-preview `PassiveShell` mapped on the Overlay layer fullscreen during a drag, masking KWin's Translucency-while-moving effect. On hybrid Intel+NVIDIA setups (CachyOS, Plasma 6.6.5, NVIDIA 595) this also forced a slower compositional path that produced the visible drag artifacts and post-snap flicker. The PassiveShell role is now downgraded to the Top layer, the same layer KDE's own panels live on, which coexists with the translucency effect. Fullscreen apps on Overlay still draw above the zone preview correctly.

## [3.0.10] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Focus-follows-mouse stopped working after any overlay appeared** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#517](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/517)): the focus-follows-mouse stacking-order walk treated the daemon's own full-screen overlay layer-shell surface as a blocking occluder, so once any OSD, snap preview, or layout picker had been shown on an autotile monitor FFM gave up and never resumed. The walk now looks through `plasmazonesd` and `plasmazones-editor` surfaces to the real window beneath. Real overlays (emoji picker, Spectacle, xdg-desktop-portal) still trip the existing guard.
- **Popups and dialogs could consume the main window's saved zone on reopen** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#518](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/518)): the `PendingRestore` queue was keyed by appId only, so opening any popup or dialog of an app whose main window had previously closed-with-a-zone-assignment consumed the queue's head entry and snapped the popup into that zone. The closing window's structural kind (normal vs transient) is now recorded on each entry, and the consume path refuses to assign an entry to a window of a different kind, leaving it for the next-opening window that does match. Pre-fix on-disk sessions reload with kind=Unknown and the gate stays permissive for them. Steam-class apps whose popups misreport as normal windows still need a separate title-regex follow-up.
- **Passive overlay shell stayed mapped and prewarmed with effects disabled** ([#515](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/515), [#519](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/519)): the passive overlay's `wl_surface` was kept mapped even when no overlay slot was live, and the prewarm path did not respect the effects-enabled toggle, leaking compositor work for users who had turned effects off. The shell now unmaps when idle and prewarm is gated on the effects-enabled setting.
- **Animation shader pattern features scaled inconsistently across monitor sizes** ([#520](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/520)): sparkle, streak, and smoke feature density was tied to an arbitrary 800px reference, so pattern density drifted across screen sizes. Features now scale by `iSurfaceScreenPos.zw` (anchor size) for constant per-pixel pitch.

## [3.0.9] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Per-virtual-desktop and per-activity assignment toggles could not be re-enabled once disabled** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#514](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/514)): the 3.0.8 fix kept the per-desktop and per-activity disable Switch's `checked` binding live across controller emissions, but the Switch was declared inside `AssignmentRow.middleContent` and Qt's `Item.enabled` cascade carried the row's disabled state down to the nested Switch, leaving no clickable control to flip the context back on. `AssignmentRow` now exposes a `contentEnabled` property that gates only the combo and clear button, so the Switch in `middleContent` stays clickable while the assignment controls grey out as before. The top-monitor Switch was unaffected because it had always been a sibling of its combo rather than a descendant.

## [3.0.8] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **KWin crashed (SIGSEGV) when snapping a window to a zone on certain monitors** ([#511](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/511), [#513](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/513)): PlasmaZones' own overlay surfaces (zone overlays, snap-assist) are KWin internal windows, and `KWin::InternalWindow::minSize()` dereferences its backing `QWindow` with no null check. When that window was not yet realised the call faulted on a null pointer inside Qt and took down the whole compositor, closing every open application. Every `minSize()` call site in the KWin effect now skips internal windows, and internal windows are rejected before they can enter the autotile pipeline.
- **A window snapped near a monitor boundary could jump onto the wrong screen** ([#513](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/513)): the drop handler paired the zone rectangle from the last drag tick with the screen resolved at the release point without checking that the two referred to the same monitor. A fast drag across a monitor boundary could therefore apply one monitor's zone rectangle to a window committed on another. The drop path now resolves the captured rectangle's own physical screen and declines the snap on a mismatch, leaving the window at its drop position instead of teleporting it.
- **The "Cancel Zone Overlay" Escape shortcut grabbed Esc system-wide** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#510](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/510)): the transient drag-overlay cancel shortcut was written to `kglobalshortcutsrc` like a user-customisable binding, so after an unexpected daemon exit the stale entry survived and KGlobalAccel kept routing Escape to a dead action, including over fullscreen games. Transient shortcuts now carry their non-persistent flag all the way to the backend, which scrubs stale on-disk records on registration and removes them on shutdown.
- **Per-monitor virtual-desktop and activity disable toggles got stuck off** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#510](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/510)): disabling a virtual desktop or activity on a monitor assignment row left the switch frozen in the off position, because an imperative property write had severed its QML binding, and re-enabling never re-drove it. The switches are now read-only consumers of a revision-counter binding, so they track the underlying state correctly.
- **Windows opened on monitors or desktops with snapping disabled were still auto-snapped** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#510](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/510)): pending-restore entries already held in memory when a context was disabled leaked through on the next window open, so a window could snap to a zone on a screen the user had turned snapping off for, until the daemon was restarted. Snap restore now runs through the same disabled-context gate as the load, save, and close paths, and the effect's instant-restore cache funnels through it too.
- **Electron child popups such as Steam image previews polluted focus tracking** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#510](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/510)): transient popups that KWin does not flag with a reliable popup window type still set a transient parent, so the focus-tracking filter recorded them as the active window and downstream placement routed real windows into the popup's zone. The activation filter now rejects the same structural window types as the snap filter, including any window with a transient parent.
- **Session-restored windows were missing from zone-occupancy tracking** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#510](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/510)): when the effect's instant-restore cache placed a window it skipped the daemon round-trip that registers the window in the snap state, so the window sat visibly in its zone but counted as unoccupied, and snap assist and empty-zone placement treated the filled zone as free. Instant-restored windows are now registered with the daemon.
- **Snap assist appeared after a bulk resnap that placed nothing** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#510](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/510)): a resnap triggered by an autotile or snap toggle, a rotation, or a virtual-screen reconfigure fired the snap-assist continuation unconditionally, so it popped for every empty zone even though no per-window snap had happened. The continuation is now anchored to the active window and shows only when the resnap actually snapped it.

## [3.0.7] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- **`bounce` drops the window in from above its frame** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): `bounce` previously revealed the window from its own top edge downward, clipped to the window box. Animation shaders can now opt into a full-surface render mode that gives them room to draw past the window, and `bounce` uses it to play niri's original drop-from-above motion, so the window travels in from above its frame.
- **Overlay cards unified on one shared frame** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): the layout OSD, navigation OSD, layout picker, and zone selector each hand-rolled their card background, border, and glow. They now share a single `PopupFrame` component, so all four read as the same surface and the soft glow is captured into the transition and animates with the card rather than being clipped away for the duration. The layout picker and zone selector pick up the same glow the OSDs use.
- **`wave-warp` gained a `frontSpeed` parameter** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): `wave-warp` and the former `crosswarp` ran the identical moving-edge warp, differing only in a front-speed dial. That dial is now `wave-warp`'s `frontSpeed` parameter (default `1.0`).

### Removed

- **`crosswarp` transition** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): it was `wave-warp` with a fixed front speed. Use `wave-warp` with its new `frontSpeed` parameter instead.
- **`plasma-flow` transition** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): it was a re-skin of `soft-warp-fade`, the same noise-driven UV warp and fade, differing only in trivial constants.

### Fixed

- **Window open / close animations rendered as ghosted, multi-copy trails on KWin** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): translation transitions (`bounce`, `fly-in`) drew several overlapping copies of the window during an open or close. `paintWindow` called `OffscreenEffect::drawWindow` directly, leaving KWin's shared draw-window iterator parked at the start, so the offscreen capture re-entered the effect and drew the window's own texture into itself. The transition now routes through `effects->drawWindow` so the capture reaches the real draw stage, and KWin's stock fade / scale / slide builtins are held off the window so they no longer render a second concurrent copy.
- **New windows flashed at their spawn position before animating into place** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): KWin places a new window (centered or smart) before the effect sees it, and the reposition into a zone or tile is asynchronous on Wayland, so a snap-restored or autotiled window visibly flickered at the centered spawn position for one to three frames. New-window pixels are now withheld until the reposition lands (with a 250 ms safety deadline), so the window first becomes visible already animating into its zone.
- **Snap-restored windows played their open animation from the screen center** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): a snap-restored window ran its `bounce` / `fly-in` open animation from the centered spawn position and then jumped to the zone once KWin's asynchronous move landed. The in-flight open transition is now pinned to the resolved zone, so the effect plays into the zone from the first frame.
- **OSD glow popped in at the end of a transition** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): the soft glow behind the layout and navigation OSDs was clipped away for the duration of a show / hide animation and snapped back into place when the animation ended. The glow is now captured together with the card so it scales and moves with it throughout the transition.
- **Faint grey halo around daemon OSDs during `bounce` / `fly-in`** ([#475](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/475)): both effects painted a faint grey border around the OSD while animating, because the effect's edge feather fell just outside the captured texture and tinted its clamped edge pixels. The edge crop is now a sub-pixel, edge-aligned antialias band, so the border is gone and the edge stays crisp.

## [3.0.6] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Settings window (and any 5th+ window) left tiled on autotile→snap** ([#504](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/504)): `calculateResnapFromAutotileOrder` capped both passes at `min(windowCount, zoneCount)`, silently dropping windows past the new layout's zone count even when their pre-autotile zone was unique and still available. With 5 autotiled windows resnapping into a 4-zone layout, the 5th was always left tiled, in practice usually the settings window (last in focus order). The first pass (restore-original-zone) now iterates ALL windows, and the positional fallback iterates all windows but breaks once every zone is claimed. `claimedZoneIndices` still prevents double-booking.
- **250+ ms stall before windows start moving on autotile→snap** ([#504](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/504)): `slotScreensChanged` ran a synchronous `setNoBorder(false)` loop on autotile disable. Each call is a Wayland decoration round-trip (30–120 ms per window) and the loop blocked kwin's main thread long enough that the queued `applyGeometriesBatch("resnap")` D-Bus signal couldn't dispatch. The affected window IDs are now stashed and drained from `slotApplyGeometriesBatch`'s `onComplete` once the resnap has been dispatched, so windows start animating to their snap positions within ~2 ms of the daemon emit instead of 250+ ms. The drain processes one window per event-loop tick so frames render between calls, keeping the concurrent OSD show animation smooth. A chunk-time check against `m_autotileScreens` skips the restore if the user rapid-cycles back into autotile mid-drain (the new toggle's `setWindowBorderless(true)` is now authoritative).
- **Focus follows mouse not re-focusing after focus steal** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#503](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/503)): `AutotileHandler::handleCursorMoved` short-circuited against `m_lastFocusFollowsMouseWindowId`, a local cache of the window it had most recently auto-focused. The cache was only invalidated by `setFocusFollowsMouse(false)`, `onWindowClosed` for the cached ID, and `slotScreensChanged`, not by Alt-Tab, a click, a daemon-driven activate, or a new window stealing focus. After any of those, the cache pointed at a window the compositor was no longer focusing on, and the next cursor pass-over matched the stale cache and skipped `activateWindow`, so focus stayed wherever it had drifted to. The cache is replaced with a live read against `KWin::effects->activeWindow()`, so the no-op gate fires only when the cursor window actually still holds focus.
- **Tiling assignments saved on the settings page silently dropped** ([#497](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/497), [#499](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/499)): `LayoutAdaptor::m_algorithmRegistry` was never wired up after the DI refactor. The daemon's composition root set it on `OverlayService`, `ZoneSelectorController`, etc., but missed `LayoutAdaptor`. Every per-monitor / per-activity tiling-mode assignment hit `setAssignmentEntry`'s validation branch (`!m_algorithmRegistry`), logged `unknown tiling algorithm: "<id>"`, and was dropped before being stored. The cascade fell back to the global default, which read like "my changes reverted." Snapping assignments persisted, and only tiling assignments vanished. The registry is now injected.
- **Daemon toggle re-enabling itself after disable** ([#497](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/497), [#499](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/499)): `setEnabled(false)` ran `systemctl --user disable`, which only blocks boot-time autostart. The installed `/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.plasmazones.service` file pins `SystemdService=plasmazones.service`, so any subsequent D-Bus call from the KWin effect (window-lifecycle callbacks like `setWindowMetadata`, `windowClosed`) routed through systemd and started the unit, and the toggle flipped back on within seconds. Switched to `systemctl --user mask`, which blocks both autostart and D-Bus-routed activation. Re-enable chains `unmask` → `enable`.
- **Snapping Assignments Monitor row reverted to old value after Save** ([#497](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/497), [#501](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/501)): `SettingsController::getLayoutForScreen` (snapping side) called the daemon's contextual `getLayoutForScreen` D-Bus method, which walks the current-desktop / current-activity cascade. The tiling counterpart already queried the explicit screen-level slot. The mismatch let a stored per-desktop or per-activity entry shadow the screen-level slot the user just wrote, so the Monitor row's own re-read pulled the higher-priority entry's old value and the combo snapped back. The snapping path now mirrors `getTilingLayoutForScreen`'s slot-level shape.
- **OSD announced the wrong layout name after editing a non-current-context slot** ([#497](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/497), [#501](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/501)): the OSD callback on `applyAssignmentChanges` resolved the layout via `layoutForScreen(screen, currentDesktop, currentActivity)`, the same cascade as the Monitor-row bug. Editing a non-current-context slot (e.g. a screen-level row while a `Desktop:1:Activity:X` entry held the visible context) produced an OSD that announced the cascade winner, the unchanged OLD layout, as if it were the change. The `assignmentChangesApplied` signal now carries the full `(screenId, virtualDesktop, activity)` of every modified slot, and the OSD resolves the layout at that exact slot.
- **Windows on disabled monitors / desktops still tracked and resurrected after restart** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#498](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/498)): a window closing on a monitor or desktop the user had disabled snap/autotile on still got a `PendingRestore` recorded, then resurfaced when the same app reopened or KWin rehomed it after the disabled screen slept. The persisted `WindowZoneAssignmentsFull`, `PendingRestoreQueues`, and `AutotilePendingRestores` are now filtered on both load and save against the current disable lists, and `WindowTrackingService` takes an injected `ShouldTrackPredicate` so live closes on disabled contexts never write the entry in the first place. The autotile engine matches via an injected `ShouldPersistRestorePredicate` at three filter sites (live, save, load), so future engine changes can't drift from the snap side ([#502](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/502)).
- **Re-enabling a disabled virtual desktop sometimes silently failing** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#498](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/498)): `setDesktopDisabled`/`setActivityDisabled` did an exact-string remove using the screen-name form QML supplied, but the read-side check resolved both connector-name and screen-ID forms. After a screen redetect, the re-enable removed zero entries and the desktop stayed disabled. Both setters now try every variant on remove.
- **Popup menus and Steam image previews snapped to weird zones** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#498](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/498)): `isTileableWindow` rejected PopupMenu / DropdownMenu / Menu / Tooltip / keep-above windows, but `shouldHandleWindow` did not. The asymmetry let a window KWin classifies as e.g. PopupMenu (Steam's chat image-preview popup, on a steamwebhelper class with no `transientFor`) pass the snap-side filter while autotile rejected it, surfacing as "snapped to a zone in snap mode" depending on the screen's current assignment. Both filters now reject the same window types.
- **Stale snap assignments from deleted layouts lingering across first-launch** ([#500](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/500)): `SnapEngine::onLayoutChanged()`'s `if (!prevLayout) return;` early-out skipped the stale-assignment cleanup on first launch, so session-restored windows whose zone IDs referenced a deleted layout stayed in `m_snapState` forever. The cleanup also kept multi-zone windows when *any* zone survived, leaving dangling zone IDs in the assignment list that downstream `multiZoneGeometry`/`zonesForWindow` would iterate. The cleanup now runs unconditionally on layout change and rebuilds multi-zone assignments to the surviving subset.
- **Critical-notification windows triggering focus tracking and appearing in the app picker** ([#500](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/500)): `notifyWindowActivated` and the app-picker enumeration rejected `isNotification` but not `isCriticalNotification`. KWin treats them as distinct window types, so a critical-notification could fire the focus shader or show up in the KCM exclusion-list picker. Both sites now reject both types.
- **`m_shuttingDown` flag not reset on daemon restart** ([#500](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/500)): `stop()` set the flag and nothing else cleared it, so any `stop()→start()` cycle (programmatic restart, tests) left every shutdown-guarded code path silenced on the second run. `start()` now resets the flag.
- **Per-screen autotile algorithm change overwrote the global default** ([#500](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/500)): changing the autotile algorithm on a single monitor (e.g. spiral on screen B while screen A stays on default) wrote the new algorithm into `Tiling.Behavior.DefaultAlgorithm`, so the next per-screen apply on screen A picked up screen B's choice as if it were the user's global default.

### Changed

- **Nix release-pipeline transform aligned with the new flake shape** ([#496](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/496)): `packaging/nix/generate-release-nix.sh` failed on v3.0.5's tag push because PR #489's flake rewrite introduced a `fetchFromGitHub,` argument and a multi-line `version = let ... in ...` block that the awk transform never knew about. The script now drops or injects `fetchFromGitHub,` to match either pre- or post-rewrite shape, and rewrites the multi-line version block to the hardcoded `version = "<VERSION>";` form. The legacy single-line rewrite stays as a fallback.

## [3.0.5] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **Shader picker dropdown disabled in the layout editor** ([#494](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/494)): checking "Enable shader effect" left the dropdown disabled and unable to select a shader because the editor's shader list arrived empty. The `availableShaders` D-Bus call returns the list as an `av` (array of variant). Unlike `a{sv}`, QtDBus does not auto-demarshal a bare `av` into a `QVariantList`. It hands the reply back wrapped in a `QDBusArgument`, so `.toList()` silently produced an empty list and every shader was dropped. The reply is now routed through `DBusVariantUtils::convertDbusArgument` first, exactly as the sibling `shaderInfo` and `translateShaderParams` queries already did.
- **Auto-snap-on-open ignored the global snapping toggle** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#492](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/492)): with `Snapping.Enabled=false`, newly-opened windows still got auto-snapped to empty or last zones. `SnapEngine::resolveWindowRestore` gated its empty-zone and last-zone fallbacks only on `modeForScreen() == Snapping`, but `modeForScreen` returns the screen's assigned layout mode, independent of the global Snapping toggle. The `snapTo*`, `restoreToPersistedZone`, and `resolveWindowRestore` D-Bus slots and the shared `applySnapResult` gate never checked the global toggle either. Only `dragStarted` did. Both chokepoints now consult `snappingEnabled()`.
- **Keyboard snap-to-zone shortcuts fired with snapping globally off** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#492](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/492)): `IPlacementEngine::isEnabled()` defaulted to `false` and `SnapEngine` never overrode it, so the shared keyboard-shortcut dispatcher had no usable gate for snap-mode shortcuts (autotile shortcuts were already gated on `AutotileEngine::isEnabled()`). `SnapEngine::isEnabled()` now mirrors `AutotileEngine` and reports `snappingEnabled()`, and the navigator dispatcher skips any shortcut whose resolved engine is disabled. Together with the auto-snap fix, `Snapping.Enabled=false` is now a total kill-switch at parity with autotiling.
- **Transient child surfaces snapped to zones** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#492](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/492)): the effect's `shouldHandleWindow()` filtered dialogs, utilities, splashes, notifications, OSDs, modals, and popups, but never consulted `w->transientFor()`, despite the comment claiming it skipped transient windows. Sibling filters in the same file (`shouldAnimateWindow`, `isTileableWindow`) already had the transient-parent check. Electron/CEF apps (Steam image previews, Discord popups, VS Code dialogs) spawn child surfaces that frequently fail to report an accurate KWin window type but always set `transientFor`, so they passed the filter and got snapped to a zone. Transient children are now excluded.
- **Generic "effect not running" message hid the real cause on bridge timeout** ([#481](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/481), [#485](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/485)): the KWin effect plugin's IID embeds KWin's exact upstream version, and KWin's effect loader silently rejects any plugin whose IID does not match the running compositor, even across patch releases. On bridge watchdog timeout the daemon now reads the installed effect plugin's embedded IID via `QPluginLoader::metaData()`, asynchronously queries the running KWin's `supportInformation()`, and names the exact build-vs-running versions and the remediation in the log and desktop notification. The version probe is non-blocking, so the degraded startup path no longer freezes the daemon event loop for the duration of the round-trip.
- **Nix flake hardened to keep PlasmaZones in sync with the host's KWin** ([#481](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/481), [#489](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/489)): expanded module documentation, a new `overlays.default` output, and explicit guidance steer users toward the NixOS module, Home Manager module, and overlay (which build against the consumer's pkgs) and away from `nix profile install` / `packages.default` (which pins to the flake's own nixpkgs and breaks silently when the host's KWin moves past `flake.lock`).

## [3.0.4] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Blank-class windows restored into each other's saved zones** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461)): a window with a blank or whitespace-only KWin class produced a `" "` app identifier that became a live key in the snap restore queue, so unrelated blank-class windows consumed each other's saved zones. App identifiers are now normalized and validated, and corrupt keys are rejected at the persist site and dropped by the session loader, which also discards pre-3.0 `"resourceName resourceClass"` keys left over from an upgrade.
- **Maximized windows ballooning when autotiled** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461)): a user-maximized window kept its `MaximizeFull` state through the autotile `moveResize`, so KWin re-asserted the maximized geometry and the reactive centering loop compounded it into runaway growth. The tile path now clears maximize state before placing the window, and the desktop-switch restore path clears it too.
- **Per-context disable ignored by auto-snap and keyboard snap** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461)): the interactive drag and autotile paths honored the per-monitor, per-desktop, and per-activity disable lists, but snap-on-open and the keyboard snap-to-zone shortcut did not, so windows still snapped on contexts the user had disabled. Both paths, and the float toggle, now gate on the disable lists.
- **Windows stayed tiled after switching to an autotile-disabled desktop**: the desktop-switch handler never restored windows on the desktop being switched *to*, so arriving on an autotile-disabled desktop left its windows tiled and borderless. The handler now runs a per-window restore pass for the arrived-at desktop.
- **Confusing new-window placement toggle labels** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461)): disabling "New windows to last zone" did not stop windows returning to zones. That behavior is governed by "Restore zones on login", whose title implied it applied only at login. Both toggles were retitled to describe what they actually do.
- **Zone geometry not clamped to the screen** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461)): gap math could produce a zone rectangle extending past the screen edge when fed malformed layout data. `applyGapsToZoneGeometry` now clamps the gapped rectangle to the screen, and resolved snap placements are logged at INFO so geometry reports are diagnosable.
- **KWin effect missing on NixOS** ([#481](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/481)): the KWin effect plugin's IID embeds KWin's exact upstream version, and KWin refuses to load an effect whose IID does not match the running compositor, even across patch releases. The flake's `nixosModules`, `homeManagerModules`, and `overlay` built PlasmaZones against the flake's own pinned `nixpkgs`, so on a rolling NixOS system whose KWin had moved past `flake.lock` the effect's IID no longer matched and KWin silently dropped it, leaving PlasmaZones absent from System Settings → Desktop Effects. The module and overlay now build against the consumer's nixpkgs, so the effect is always compiled against the KWin the user actually runs, matching the exact-version pinning the RPM, Debian, and Arch packages already do.
- **Support report crashed on Qt 6.11+** ([#481](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/481)): qttools' `qdbus`/`qdbus6` segfaults at process exit on Qt 6.11+ (a static-destruction-order crash in `registerComplexDBusType`'s `QMetaType` cleanup) when introspecting an object that exposes complex D-Bus types, which `/PlasmaZones` does. The crash could discard the buffered support report before it was printed. `plasmazones-report` now prefers `busctl`, which is unaffected and present on every systemd distro, over `qdbus`, and the bug-report template recommends the `busctl` invocation instead of `qdbus6`.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Zones sliding under a top panel** ([#461](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/461), [#472](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/472)): with a top panel, zones slid *under* the panel and the bottom edge was over-reserved. The available-geometry heuristic could only guess which screen edge a panel's strut belonged to, and guessed wrong when the plasmashell panel query returned no panels. The KWin effect now reports the compositor's authoritative work area (`clientArea`), which carries correct per-edge strut attribution and auto-hide handling, and the heuristic remains the fallback for sessions where the effect is not loaded.
- **openSUSE Build Service packaging**: cleared the remaining issues blocking a clean OBS build: a missing `wayland-scanner` build dependency, missing transitive KWin `find_package` dependencies, unowned directories, development files leaking into the runtime package, actionable rpmlint warnings, and changelog macros expanding inside spec-file comments.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **KWin effect bridge status in diagnostics**: support reports and the daemon now surface whether the KWin effect bridge is connected, so it is clear at a glance whether the required effect is loaded and communicating with the daemon.
- **openSUSE packages on OBS**: the release pipeline now publishes openSUSE packages to the openSUSE Build Service.

### Changed

- **ScreenManager decoupled from `QScreen`**: the screen add, remove, move, and resize lifecycle moved behind an injectable `IScreenProvider` seam so it can be regression-tested without a live display. This is an internal refactor with no user-visible behavior change. It adds regression coverage for the multi-monitor geometry path.

### Fixed

- **Layout shift after a screen powers off and back on** ([#465](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/465), [#467](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/467)): when a monitor reappeared at a transient `(0,0)` origin on DPMS wake or hotplug, its available geometry stayed pinned to the old origin even after the output settled, shifting every layout anchored to that screen toward the desktop origin. Available geometry is now recomputed whenever a screen moves or resizes.
- **Panels ignored on the first layout pass** ([#466](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/466)): the `panelGeometryReady` signal could fail to fire on the first panel query, so components computing initial zone geometry at startup laid windows out against the full screen rect instead of the panel-reserved area. The signal now fires reliably on the first panel reading.
- **EPEL RPM builds** ([#462](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/462)): macros inside spec-file comments were expanded by `rpmbuild` on EPEL and broke the build. Comment macros are now escaped.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **AUR `plasmazones-bin` package**: ship `LICENSE` and `COPYING.LESSER` in the release tarball. The binary package installs its licenses from the tarball root and was failing in `package()` because those files were never staged into it.
- **COPR builds**: the `kwin_version` spec macro expanded to a multi-line string when `kwin-devel` was absent, as in COPR's minimal SRPM-build chroot, which injected a newline into every `Requires: kwin = ...` and aborted the build with `Unknown tag: 6.6.0`. The macro now always resolves to a single version token.
- **Debian package**: version the `libplasmazones_rendering` shared library so it installs with a SONAME, consistent with every other shipped library and silencing a `dpkg-shlibdeps` warning.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Virtual screens for ultrawide monitors**: physical monitors can be subdivided into independent logical screens, each with its own layouts, autotile state, snap-assist, OSDs, shortcuts, and per-desktop or per-activity assignments. A new `VirtualScreenSwapper` exposes swap and rotate D-Bus methods plus global shortcuts, and a monitor-level OSD acknowledges the action so the user sees which regions moved. The layout editor and settings app are virtual-screen aware throughout, and the configuration UI moved from the editor into the settings app.
- **Animation App Rules**: a new Animations → App Rules page assigns motion curves, shader overrides, and per-event timings to specific window classes. The resolver cascades through global, app-rule, and window-filter layers inside the kwin-effect, and the editor supports curve picking, shader-parameter overrides, lock and randomize controls, and window-class filtering with a `Disable animations` short-circuit. A two-layer resolver with leaf seeds gives widgets distinctive tunings even when they share a parent rule.
- **Unified `PassiveOverlayShell`**: OSDs, snap-assist, the layout picker, the zone selector, and the main zone overlay now run inside one shell surface instead of five separate layer-shell windows. The shell is click-through except when a modal popup is up, hides itself when no slot is visible so clicks pass through, releases its input region after every slot show, and enforces explicit z-order. Slots animate independently, so a snap-assist show no longer cancels an in-flight OSD. Replaces the legacy `NotificationOverlay.qml` lifecycle.
- **Krohnkite-style autotile reorder and unlimited stack**: dragging a tiled window onto another inserts or swaps it into the target slot live via a new Reorder drag behavior. A new Unlimited overflow lets the stack grow past the algorithm's natural cap instead of evicting windows. Drag-insert has always-active and toggle modes matching the snap trigger, and the dropdowns are exposed in Settings → Tiling → Behavior.
- **Animation engine and 47 ported shader transitions**: window transitions run through a new `OffscreenEffect` redirect path with vertex-shader plumbing, parent-FBO bounds extent, live-texture sampling of the rendered surface, and direction-aware leg signals. The release ships compatibility shims that port 28 niri animation shaders via `niri_compat` and 9 Burn-My-Windows shaders via `bmw_compat`, plus 10 new BMW-inspired transitions, an audio-reactive `neon-city` cityscape, a Matrix rain port, a 3D `chrome-protocol` rewrite, and user-texture support for image-driven effects. OSDs use surface sampling for morph, slide, slidefade, and popin.
- **Animations settings UI overhaul**: an eight-phase rework adds an `AnimationsPageController` and drill-down sub-pages for OSDs, overlays, shaders, motion sets, app rules, widgets, windows, and side panels. The Shaders page hosts a per-event shader picker backed by a generic shader browser. Motion sets bundle themed overrides users can switch between. A timing-mode toggle on the General page and change detection on save round it out. A separate Snapping → Shaders page exposes the same browser for snap-assist, zone-selector, and layout-picker effects.
- **Layout ordering for cycling**: the cycle shortcut and zone-selector cycling follow a user-configurable order set under Settings → Snapping → Ordering and Settings → Tiling → Ordering, instead of the implicit save-time order.
- **Per-mode disable lists**: snapping and autotiling each have their own exclusion lists for monitors, virtual desktops, and activities, replacing the single global disable. The disabled-context OSD explains which exclusion is active so the user can find the toggle.
- **Native-feeling wheel scroll in settings** ([#405](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/405)): every Flickable settings page uses `Kirigami.WheelHandler` so scroll speed matches the rest of Plasma System Settings, while preserving the Flickable drag-to-flick path.
- **Hold/Toggle controls now work in always-active mode** ([#249](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/issues/249)): "Hold to activate" and "Toggle mode" stay enabled when "Activate on every drag" is on, with inverted semantics. The configured trigger deactivates the overlay instead of activating it, so a binding like Right Mouse Button activates when always-active is off and deactivates when on. Esc continues to cancel the drag entirely.
- **Global "auto-assign new windows for all layouts" toggle** ([#370](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/issues/370)): a master switch in Snapping Behavior → Window Handling that forces auto-assign on for every manual layout, regardless of the per-layout icon. Effective behavior is `globalToggle OR layout.autoAssign`, and the default is off so existing semantics are preserved on upgrade. While the global is on, the per-layout toggle is disabled and the Auto/Manual badge in the Layouts grid, layout combo, zone selector, layout picker, and layout OSD shows the effective on state.
- **Separate "Desktop switch OSD" toggle** ([#372](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/issues/372), [#373](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/373)): the layout-preview OSD that fires on virtual-desktop change, activity change, and daemon startup is now governed by its own setting, `Snapping.Effects/OsdOnDesktopSwitch`, independent of `OsdOnLayoutSwitch`. Manual layout switches continue to gate on the existing layout-switch toggle. Default is `true` to preserve current behavior. **Upgrade note**: users who previously set `OsdOnLayoutSwitch=false` to silence the startup or VD-switch flash will see those OSDs return on first launch under the new schema. Toggle "Desktop switch OSD" off in Settings → On-Screen Display to restore the old quiet behavior.
- **New D-Bus methods**: `setPerScreenSettings` accepts a batched per-screen settings map so the editor and KCM can apply screen-scoped changes in one round-trip. `requestRunningWindows` and the `runningWindowsAvailable` signal give the App Rules editor an async window picker that doesn't block while the daemon enumerates KWin clients.
- **Phosphor SDK foundation libraries**: core services are extracted into reusable LGPL libraries, each with its own export macro, headers, and minimal Qt dependencies. The set covers `phosphor-engine` (renamed from `phosphor-engine-api`), `phosphor-layout-api`, `phosphor-animation`, `phosphor-shaders` (extracted from `phosphor-shell`), `phosphor-workspaces` (VirtualDesktopManager and ActivityManager), `phosphor-placement` (WindowTrackingService and WindowRegistry), `phosphor-tiles`, `phosphor-zones` for manual zone-layout primitives, `phosphor-screens`, `phosphor-snap-engine` and `phosphor-tile-engine` for the physically moved SnapEngine and AutotileEngine, `phosphor-config`, `phosphor-fsloader` (renamed from `phosphor-jsonloader`, with the `WatchedDirectorySet` base extracted), `phosphor-shell-patterns`, `phosphor-wayland` (renamed from `phosphor-shell`), and `phosphor-layer`. Geometry primitives use domain-neutral identifiers so the libraries are reusable outside PlasmaZones. `SnapState` is now the single source of truth for snap window state, owned by `SnapEngine`. Forwarding headers were removed in favor of direct library includes.
- **Phosphor compositor SDK**: a new `phosphor-compositor` library exposes `DaemonClient` plus handler interfaces, extracted from the old `compositor-common`, so third-party Wayland compositors such as river can host the placement, tiling, and overlay services without depending on KWin.

### Changed

- **KCM Apply now respects the layout-switch OSD toggle**: the per-screen preview OSDs emitted after a System Settings → Apply previously fired unconditionally, ignoring the user's `OsdOnLayoutSwitch` setting. They now gate on the same flag as cycle, quick-layout, and zone-selector drop. The locked-context OSD remains unconditional so it can explain why a requested change had no visible effect on a locked screen.
- **Drag protocol refactor** ([#310](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/310)): the kwin-effect is now a dumb relay for drag events. The daemon owns all drag routing decisions through a new `beginDrag`, `updateDragCursor`, and `endDrag` protocol with typed `DragPolicy` and `DragOutcome` structs. The previous effect-side distributed state (`m_dragBypassedForAutotile`, `m_cachedZoneSelectorEnabled`, `m_autotileScreens` local cache) went stale during the asynchronous settings-reload window and produced ~40 seconds of dead drags in the reporter's log on #310. The new protocol makes the daemon the single source of truth at drag start, drag cursor update (30Hz fire-and-forget), and drag end. Cross-VS mid-drag flips are emitted by the daemon via `dragPolicyChanged` and applied locally by the plugin, replacing the effect-side flip loop that walked `KWin::effects->screens()` against a local autotile-screen cache. Pinned against drift by a new 8-state truth table test.
- **Meta-F float toggle now runs daemon-local** ([#310](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/310)): the keyboard shortcut previously made 4 D-Bus hops across 3 processes (KWin → daemon → effect → daemon → engine → effect), stalling under any D-Bus backpressure and producing the "pressed Meta-F, nothing happened, seconds later it toggled" symptom. It now reads the active window from `WindowTrackingAdaptor::m_lastActiveWindowId`, fresh frame geometry from a 50ms-debounced shadow (`setFrameGeometry`), and dispatches to the engine in-process. One D-Bus hop remains for the daemon → effect `applyGeometryRequested` paint, targeting sub-50ms latency from keypress to visible toggle. The 100ms debounce on `handleFloat` has been dropped since the in-process path has no D-Bus latency to coalesce.
- **Settings nesting made compile-time**: `ISettings` gains `isZoneSelectorActive()` and `isSnapAssistActive()` composite accessors that return `snappingEnabled() && <child>Enabled()`. Consumers can no longer forget the parent-gate check when reading a nested `Snapping.*` flag. Raw child accessors remain for KCM settings UI code that genuinely needs the unaffected value.

### Fixed

- **No default layout assignment on brand-new virtual desktops** ([#368](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/issues/368)): a fresh virtual desktop had no stored entry in the per-context assignment table, so the cascade fell through to a snap-only `defaultLayout()` that had no concept of mode. Users with autotile configured globally saw new desktops behave as if no mode were set at all: autotile never activated, snapping was disabled, drag overlays did not appear, and windows just floated. The cascade now consults a settings-derived `AssignmentEntry` provider as the final step, applying the user's intended mode and default to fresh desktops.
- **Autotile shortcut-adjusted ratio and master count did not persist** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): shortcut adjustments to the autotile master ratio and master count updated runtime state but not the config, the per-algorithm saved settings, or Settings, so the change reverted on the next reload. Shortcut-driven adjustments now propagate through all three with signal-blocking so the values survive every propagation path.
- **Snap-assist showed occupied windows from other virtual desktops** ([#323](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/323)): the drag-path occupancy filter walked the live window list without scoping to the current virtual desktop, so a zone that was empty on the user's desktop showed as occupied because a window from another desktop matched it. Now filtered to the current desktop before the occupancy check.
- **Per-activity layout assignments could be overridden by per-monitor defaults** ([#413](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/413)): in the layout registry, the fallback chain resolved monitor defaults before per-activity overrides, so a user-set activity-scoped layout could lose to a monitor default that predated it. Activity assignments now win in the precedence order, matching what the assignments UI implies.
- **Layouts context menu eventually stopped opening** ([#406](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/406)): in the Layouts page, the right-click context menu would silently fail to open after enough show and hide cycles because separator visibility was imperatively flipped on each show, eventually leaving a dead `null`-context binding. Separator visibility is now declarative and the dead null-context guard was removed.
- **Cycle-triggered resnap affected windows on other virtual desktops**: the daemon's resnap pass after a cycle shortcut walked every tracked window instead of scoping to the active virtual desktop, so cycling on one VD could nudge windows on another VD that happened to share a layout. Now scoped to the active VD.

## [2.8.8] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- **KWin effect plugin fails to load after a KWin patch update**: The kwin-effect plugin's IID embeds KWin's exact upstream version string (`KWIN_PLUGIN_VERSION_STRING` in `config-kwin.h`). KWin refuses to load any effect whose IID doesn't match its own version, even across patch releases (e.g. 6.6.4 to 6.6.5). All 2.8.7 packages were built against KWin 6.6.4 and stopped loading the moment distros shipped 6.6.5. Package metadata now pins KWin to the exact upstream patch version captured at build time (RPM `Requires: kwin = %{kwin_version}`, Debian `kwin-common (= ${kwin:Version})`, Arch `kwin=$_kwin_ver`). Packages now refuse to install on a mismatched KWin instead of installing silently broken, and users get a clean dependency error and CI rebuilds against each KWin patch release.

## [2.8.7] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **`BUILD_KWIN_EFFECT` CMake option** ([#321](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/321)): The `kwin-effect` subdirectory hard-requires `find_package(KWin 6.6 REQUIRED)`, which aborted the entire configure step on distros shipping older KWin (Debian 13 / KWin 6.3.6, Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40) even though the daemon, editor, KCM, settings app, and QPA plugin build cleanly there. The new `BUILD_KWIN_EFFECT` option (default `ON`) lets packagers pass `-DBUILD_KWIN_EFFECT=OFF` to build everything except the C++ effect plugin. Thanks @iubayb.

### Fixed
- **Qt 6.9 `QWaylandWindow::updateExposure()` compile error on Qt 6.8** ([#321](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/pull/321)): `layershellwindow.cpp` called a private method added in Qt 6.9, breaking the build on Qt 6.8.x. Guarded the call with `QT_VERSION_CHECK(6, 9, 0)` and fell back to the underlying public QPA mechanism (`QWindowSystemInterface::handleExposeEvent`) on older Qt. Same visible effect, same expose-event delivery. Thanks @iubayb.

## [2.8.6] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Emby and other Electron/CEF apps silently break after class rename** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): The daemon's runtime primary key was `"appId|uuid"`, a composite that baked a mutable attribute into the identity used for every per-window map. Emby opens as `emby-beta`, gets tracked, then KWin rebroadcasts it as `media.emby.client.beta`. Every subsequent lookup under the new composite missed, so `toggleWindowFloat`, focus navigation, and snap operations silently failed until a mode toggle rebuilt state from scratch. Introduced `WindowRegistry` as the single source of truth for live-window metadata keyed by the stable KWin instance id. The kwin-effect pushes class/desktop-file/title on `windowAdded` and on every `windowClassChanged` / `desktopFileNameChanged` / `captionChanged` so the daemon always reads the live class instead of parsing a frozen first-seen composite. Session persistence uses `currentAppIdFor()` at save time so a renamed window lands under its live class on disk.

## [2.8.5] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Master window balloons to 100% on notifications** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): KWin transiently flipped a tiled window's `isMinimized()` state to true and back within ~1-2ms whenever a plasmashell notification popup rearranged stacking. The autotile engine recalculated with N-1 windows, tiling the surviving master to the full screen, before unfloating ~ms later. Users saw the master briefly balloon to 100% on every notification. In the worst reported log, the stack window cycled float/unfloat 34 times in a single day with no user interaction. Fixed with two layers of defense: (1) a class-based filter for Plasma shell layer-shell surfaces (`plasmashell`, `plasma.emojier`, `plasma.notifications`, `krunner`) that don't reliably set `isNotification()`/`isPopupWindow()` on Wayland, removing 508 stray tracking events a day, and (2) a 75ms debounce on the minimize→float commit that coalesces spurious minimize/unminimize cycles to zero D-Bus calls. Real user minimizes always last longer than 75ms so they commit normally.
- **Cannot re-enable PlasmaZones from settings after killing a terminal-run daemon** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): When users ran `plasmazonesd` manually for log collection, systemd's managed instance lost the D-Bus name race and exited. `Restart=on-failure` retried until `StartLimitBurst` was exhausted, leaving the unit wedged in `failed` state. `systemctl --user start` then silently did nothing until logout. `DaemonController::startDaemon` now chains `reset-failed` → `start` so the settings toggle recovers the unit automatically.

## [2.8.4] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Ephemeral windows entering autotile tree** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): The KWin effect's minimum window size filter initialized to 0x0 and was only populated after an async D-Bus settings load. During that startup race window, all windows, including Steam splash screens and Electron notification popups, bypassed the size check and entered the tiling tree. The cache now initializes to 200x150 (matching daemon defaults) so the filter is active from effect load.

### Added
- **`--log-file` flag for daemon**: `plasmazonesd --log-file /tmp/pz.log` redirects all log output to a file (append mode, thread-safe). Combines with `--debug` for easy bug report capture without piping or `journalctl`.
- **Autotile eligibility diagnostics**: Windows accepted into the autotile tree now log their window class, skipSwitcher, keepAbove, and transient properties at debug level, making it possible to identify why specific windows pass the filter.

## [2.8.3] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **`--debug` flag for daemon** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): `plasmazonesd --debug` (or `-d`) enables debug-level logging for all `plasmazones.*` categories, replacing the need for `qtlogging.ini` or environment variables when capturing diagnostic output.

### Improved
- **Autotile diagnostic depth**: Debug logging now includes per-window min-sizes used in zone calculation, before/after zone comparison from `enforceWindowMinSizes`, per-window applied geometries in `applyTiling`, min-size cap values, stale min-size clearing on unfloat, and split tree ratio restoration detail. These additions target the intermittent master-goes-to-100% ratio bug reported in #271.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Autotile windows pushed off-screen on retile** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): When a window's minimum size exceeded its assigned zone (common with browsers on ultrawide monitors), the Wayland centering code centered the oversized window within the zone, pushing it to a negative x/y position, literally off the left edge of the screen. Oversized windows are now left/top-aligned in their zone instead of centered, staying on-screen while the daemon adjusts zone sizes.
- **Min-size clearing regression from 2.8.1**: Removed the indiscriminate `m_windowMinSizes` clearing in `onScreenGeometryChanged()` added in 2.8.1. The min-size feedback loop it guarded against was already eliminated by removing the `targetZone.width()` fallback, so the clearing just forced windows through unnecessary centering discovery cycles, triggering the off-screen push above.

### Improved
- **Autotile diagnostic logging**: Added logging to key autotile paths. Window open/remove events now log IDs and min-sizes, `recalculateLayout` logs zone geometries and split ratios, screen geometry changes are logged, and window eligibility rejections now include the reason. This makes autotile ratio issues diagnosable from `journalctl` without code changes.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Autotile ratio stuck after notification dismiss** ([#271](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/271)): Eliminated a min-size feedback loop where the KWin effect's Wayland centering code fell back to reporting the target zone width as a discovered minimum size for apps without a declared `minSize()`. This self-reinforcing constraint locked the master/stack split ratio until the user minimized and restored a window. Only the compositor's declared minimum is now reported.
- **Stale min-sizes after screen geometry change**: Discovered min-sizes for windows on a screen are now cleared when the available geometry changes (e.g., panel/systray resize), preventing stale constraints from overriding the user's split ratio on geometry-triggered retiles.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Support report generator** ([#302]): `plasmazones-report` script collects daemon logs, config, and data directory into a tar.gz archive for bug reports and discussions.
- **Autotile window preservation** ([#301]): Autotiled windows now survive layout switches, mode toggles, and daemon restarts, matching the preservation behavior that snapped windows already had.
- **Disabled-context OSD** ([#297]): Visual feedback when toggling PlasmaZones on a disabled desktop, activity, or screen. Shows why nothing happened and where to change it.
- **Config v2 nested schema** ([#295]): `config.json` restructured from flat keys to a nested hierarchy mirroring the settings UI. Existing v1 configs are migrated automatically.
- **Systemd service autostart**: Enabling the daemon toggle now also enables the systemd user service so PlasmaZones starts on login.

### Changed
- **Assignments split to `assignments.json`** ([#300]): Layout-to-screen assignments moved out of the main config into a dedicated file, reducing config churn and merge conflicts.
- **Session state split to `session.json`** ([#298]): Ephemeral session data (window positions, floating state) moved to its own file so it doesn't dirty the user config.
- **Autotile persistence refactor** ([#296]): Session persistence moved from `AutoTileState` to `WindowTrackingAdaptor` for cleaner separation between tiling logic and state serialization.
- **Settings consolidation**: `settings-window.conf` merged into `plasmazones-settings.conf`.

### Fixed
- **Assignment persistence across restart** ([#303]): Layout assignments and tiling window order now survive daemon restarts and mode-cycle toggling.
- **Autotile ratio retry** ([#299]): Bounded retry for transient geometry failures during autotile layout. Stale min-size overrides are cleared after resize settles.
- **Config purge unknown keys** ([#300]): Unknown root-level groups are removed on save, preventing config pollution from obsolete or misspelled keys.
- **Window restore after config v2 migration** ([#295]): `loadState` was bypassing `IConfigBackend` group API after the schema change, breaking window restore on first launch.
- **Watcher double-delete guard** ([#302]): Fixed a use-after-free race in the file watcher teardown path.
- **Format warning in `splitDotPath`**: Fixed `qsizetype` vs `%d` printf mismatch.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Custom algorithm parameter UI** ([#294]): Scripted algorithms declaring `@param` metadata now get auto-generated controls in the Tiling settings page. Sliders for numbers, switches for bools, and combo boxes for enums.
- **Ratio step size slider** ([#292]): Configurable step size for master ratio keyboard shortcut adjustments.

### Fixed
- **Per-screen master ratio and count** ([#292]): Per-screen overrides for master ratio and count were not persisted correctly. Fixed key constants, slider bindings, and race conditions in the per-screen config path.
- **Reset to defaults clears per-algorithm settings** ([#292]): Resetting to defaults now properly clears saved per-algorithm autotile settings.
- **OSD shown at ratio bounds** ([#292]): Master ratio OSD was suppressed when the value hit min/max. Now always shown on shortcut press.
- **Shader dark band at adjacent zone edges**: Eliminated a visible seam in the Aretha Shell shader where neighboring zones shared an edge.
- **Shader category duplication in settings**: Fixed duplicate shader categories and easing preview binding errors.
- **Editor shader error box**: Restored the shader compilation error display in the layout editor preview.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **JSON config backend** ([#286]): Config migrated from INI (`~/.config/plasmazonesrc`) to JSON (`~/.config/plasmazones/config.json`). Existing INI configs are migrated automatically on first launch. The JSON backend supports nested groups, proper array/object serialization, and atomic writes.
- **Master ratio/count OSD values** ([#289]): Shortcut adjustments now show the actual value in the navigation OSD: "Master ratio → 65%" and "Master count → 2".
- **Tumbleweed Drift shader improvements**: New wind-blown sand streams, stronger audio reactivity across all bands, faster animation speeds, larger dust devils, and full-surface treble sparkle. Sand streams follow the configured wind direction.

### Changed
- **Settings navigation**: App Rules moved under Snapping section. Child navigation pages have dividers for visual grouping.

### Fixed
- **Drag-to-float keeps drop position** ([#289]): Dragging a window off the autotile layout no longer snaps it back to its pre-autotile position. The daemon's geometry restore is skipped for drag-initiated floats.
- **Shortcut ratio/count persistence** ([#289]): Master ratio and count changes via keyboard shortcuts were only in memory due to QSignalBlocker suppressing the save path. Added debounced save so values survive reboots.
- **Algorithm switch persistence** ([#289]): Algorithm changes via settings also use QSignalBlocker and had the same missing-save issue. Now triggers the same debounced save.
- **Minimum window size for autotile** ([#290]): The user-configured minimum window width/height was never checked in the autotile path. Small utility windows like the Plasma emoji picker entered the tiling tree, causing rapid float/unfloat cycles that broke the master ratio. Now enforced in the KWin effect before windows reach the daemon.
- **Focus-follows-mouse through small windows** ([#290]): Windows below the minimum size threshold no longer steal focus on hover. They block focus-through like excluded apps and popups.
- **Shortcut debouncing** ([#288]): Rotate, float toggle, and layout cycle shortcuts are now debounced to prevent rapid-fire D-Bus calls from key repeat.
- **Overlay Vulkan surface churn**: Non-shader overlays are hidden instead of destroyed and recreated, reducing Vulkan surface create/destroy cycles.
- **Snap assist window pooling**: Snap assist reuses its window instead of creating a new one each time, and rejects stale layout requests.
- **JSON config serialization**: Arrays and objects in the config file are properly serialized through the flat map representation.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Tumbleweed Drift shader**: openSUSE Tumbleweed branded zone overlay with animated desert landscape, rolling pinwheel logos, dust devils, sand particles, erosion flow lines, and responsive audio reactivity.
- **Neon Venom and Chrome Protocol shaders**.
- **Voxel-terrain improvements**: Multipass with depth buffer, highlight visibility, pulse-flow label effects.
- **Shader engine**: Depth buffer via MRT, per-channel filter/wrapping modes for multipass buffers, shader presets from registry.
- **Autotile JS API enrichment** ([#274]): Per-window context, custom parameters, and lifecycle hooks for scripted algorithms.
- **Layout ordering settings** ([#281]): Configure snapping and tiling cycle order in settings.
- **What's New dialog** ([#282]): Per-release highlights shown on first launch after update.
- **Settings `.desktop` file** for application launchers.

### Changed
- **Shared config backend** ([#276]): Single `QSettingsConfigBackend` shared across daemon instead of per-component instances.
- **Stale config key purging** ([#280]): Settings save removes obsolete keys to prevent config pollution.
- **ConfigDefaults reference constants** ([#278]): Autotile defaults reference `Defaults::` constants instead of duplicating values.

### Fixed
- **Shader parameter defaults**: `customParams` initialized to `-1.0` sentinel so fallback checks work on first frame.
- **DOF focal depth stability**: Multi-sample region averaging prevents jittery depth-of-field.
- **Vulkan surface lifecycle**: Fixes for surface creation on rapid show/hide, teardown crashes, keep-alive window management, deferred `QVulkanInstance` creation, scissor state, and swapchain colorspace.
- **Rendering pipeline stability**: RHI resource release on scene stop, multipass crash guards, SRB resets on label texture resize, texture upload ordering.
- **OSD improvements**: Navigation self-destruct fix, masterCount wiring, autotile metadata in layout OSD, per-screen dismiss.
- **Focus-follows-mouse**: No longer focuses through excluded or overlay windows.
- **Autotile shortcut sync**: Master ratio and count changes from shortcuts now persist to config.
- **Settings stability**: Single-instance enforcement, daemon toggle desync from broken QML bindings, RenderingBackend read from ungrouped config keys.
- **i18n**: Correct plural form selection in `i18np` without `.ts` files.
- **Layout picker**: No longer overwrites the global default layout when selecting per-screen.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Autotile split ratio feedback loop** ([#273]): The KWin effect reported the window's actual frame geometry as its "minimum size" when a window resisted shrinking (e.g., during browser media loading). This inflated min-size was never cleared, creating a feedback loop that expanded the master zone to ~90% or full width. Now uses the window's declared `minSize()` from the compositor, with zone-size fallback for apps without declared minimums. Daemon caps all received min-sizes at 90% of screen dimension as a secondary safety net.
- **Overlay/popup focus guard for autotile** ([#272]): Windows with `keepAbove` set (Spectacle, color pickers, screen rulers) were entering the autotile tree and stealing focus when `focusNewWindows` was enabled. Added `keepAbove()` check to `isTileableWindow()` so overlay/utility tools are excluded from autotiling.
- **"Hold to activate" trigger reset on daemon restart** ([#275]): Qt's QConfFile cache was shared between the Settings and LayoutManager backends (same file, same format). When `reparseConfiguration()` destroyed the Settings QSettings, the LayoutManager's instance kept the stale QConfFile alive, preventing re-read from disk. Settings changed by the external settings app were invisible to the daemon's reload, silently reverting `DragActivationTriggers` to the default (Alt). Now reads the file directly and overwrites the QSettings cache.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Layout popup algorithm previews**: Algorithm previews in the zone selector and layout picker popup now respect algorithm metadata (zone number display mode, producesOverlappingZones, master indicator dots) like the settings app does.
- **Window picker exclusion lists**: WindowPickerDialog was shadowing the `appSettings` context property, causing addExcludedApplication/addExcludedWindowClass to silently fail. Now routes through settingsController.settings.
- **Autotile split ratio state corruption**: Reset suspiciously high split ratios (> max - 0.05) on state load to prevent layouts from being stuck with unusable splits.
- **Autotile cursor hover focus**: The hover-to-focus check in AutotileHandler was using the old `shouldHandleWindow` method. It now uses `isTileableWindow` for consistency.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Independent autotile sticky window handling**: Separate setting for how autotiling handles sticky windows (on all desktops), independent from the snapping setting. Configurable in Tiling > Behavior.

### Fixed
- **Editor shader crash**: Null pointer dereference in `ZoneShaderNodeRhi::render()` when switching between multipass shaders, from a missing null check on `m_multiBufferTextures[i]`.
- **Editor undo crash**: Guard `m_undoController` dereferences in `setCurrentShaderParams()`, `setShaderParameter()`, `resetShaderParameters()`, and `switchShader()` to match existing pattern.
- **Arch packaging**: PKGBUILDs referenced `kbuildsycoca.hook` and `plasmazones-refresh-sycoca` as standalone source files instead of using in-tree paths, causing `makepkg` to fail with "cannot stat" errors.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Scripted tiling algorithms** ([#256], [#259]): All 24 tiling algorithms are now JavaScript, running in a sandboxed QJSEngine with hot-reload. The 15 former C++ algorithms have been converted to JS with identical behavior. Six new algorithms added: Cascade, Corner Master, Floating Center, Horizontal Deck, Paper, and Stair. Custom user algorithms are loaded from `~/.local/share/plasmazones/algorithms/`.
- **Dwindle (Memory) algorithm**: Dwindle variant with a persistent split tree, where resizing one tile does not affect others. Split positions survive window close/reopen.
- **Multi-compositor support** ([#261]): Custom `pz-layer-shell` QPA plugin replaces the `LayerShellQt` dependency. PlasmaZones now works on any Wayland compositor with `zwlr_layer_shell_v1` support (Hyprland, Sway, Wayfire, niri, COSMIC, river, labwc).
- **Vulkan rendering backend** ([#264]): Optional Vulkan backend for zone overlay rendering with automatic fallback to OpenGL on unsupported hardware or driver crash. User-selectable in **Settings → General**.
- **New Layout / New Algorithm wizards** ([#263]): Guided dialogs for creating zone layouts from templates and tiling algorithms from a starter script, accessible from the settings app.
- **Layout filter bar** ([#265]): Replace hardcoded layout groups with configurable group-by, sort-by, and filter controls in the layout list.
- **Disable per virtual desktop / activity** ([#260]): Disable PlasmaZones on specific virtual desktops or activities per screen. Overlay hides automatically on disabled contexts.
- **Settings UX polish** ([#268], [#269]): Two-line description rows, collapsible card sections, consolidated footer bar with Apply/Reset/Defaults, sidebar page badges, inline toggle switches replacing disable checkboxes.
- **Single-instance settings app** ([#270]): `plasmazones-settings` is now single-instance via D-Bus. Launching it again raises the existing window and navigates to the requested page (`--page <name>` / `-p <name>`).
- **Unsaved changes confirmation**: Settings app prompts before closing with unsaved changes. Reset and Defaults buttons require confirmation.
- **Master indicator dots**: Algorithm grid cards show dots indicating which zones are master positions.
- **Memory indicator icon**: Stateful algorithms (Dwindle Memory) show a persistence icon in the algorithm selector.
- **Per-algorithm settings storage**: Split ratio, master count, and other parameters are saved per-algorithm rather than globally.
- **Algorithm import and open folder**: Import `.js` algorithm files and open the user algorithm directory from the tiling settings page.
- **Algorithm capability grouping**: Tiling algorithms grouped by capability (Built-in / Extras / Custom) in the settings UI.
- **D-Bus `zoneIds` array**: Window state responses now include the full list of zone IDs a window occupies.

### Changed
- **LayerShellQt replaced**: Custom `pz-layer-shell` QPA plugin is now the sole layer-shell backend. Packagers: drop `layer-shell-qt` build dependency, add `qt6-wayland` and `wayland-scanner`.
- **Config keys centralized** ([#266]): All config group names and key strings extracted to `ConfigDefaults` accessors. No more inline string literals in settings code.
- **Settings page IDs renamed**: `snap-*` / `tile-*` page IDs renamed to `snapping-*` / `tiling-*` for consistency.
- **Algorithm registry**: Hardcoded algorithm ID constants replaced with a data-driven registry. Algorithm metadata (name, capabilities, flags) comes from JS `@tag` annotations.
- **README streamlined**: Detailed algorithm table, shader table, D-Bus API reference, and project structure moved to the wiki. README reduced from 742 to 593 lines with summary + wiki links.

### Removed
- **LayerShellQt dependency**: No longer required. Replaced by `pz-layer-shell` QPA plugin.
- **C++ tiling algorithm implementations**: All algorithms are now JavaScript. The C++ implementations have been removed.
- **Legacy migration code**: Removed all config key migration and backward-compatibility shims from settings save/load paths.
- **kcfg/kcfgc schema files**: Unused KConfig schema files removed.
- **Accent stripe feature**: Removed from `SettingsCard` component.

### Fixed
- **Window restore on daemon restart**: Bypass QSettings cache in `loadState` so window-to-zone mappings are read fresh from disk after daemon restart ([#268]).
- **Multipass shader rendering**: Fix ping-pong buffer handling in overlay renderer for multi-pass shaders.
- **Editor shader menu crash**: Rewrite shader submenu to prevent Qt 6 `finalizeExitTransition` use-after-free when selecting a shader while the menu is animating closed.
- **Editor context menu crash**: Use shared context menu instance to prevent `QQmlData` use-after-free when zones update while the popup is open.
- **NVIDIA Vulkan crash**: Suppress spurious shutdown crash on NVIDIA drivers and auto-fallback to OpenGL.
- **NVIDIA EGL crash in editor**: Guard shader preview reload against EGL context loss on NVIDIA.
- **Layout picker dimmed backdrop**: Remove unintended dimmed background overlay from the fullscreen layout picker.
- **CAVA crash suppression**: Suppress misleading "CAVA Crashed" error message caused by process-group SIGTERM during daemon shutdown.
- **Shader preview bindings**: Restore reactive label and wallpaper texture bindings in the editor shader preview.
- **Settings dirty flag on navigation**: Prevent spurious unsaved-changes prompts when switching between settings pages.
- **Slider snap-back bug**: Fix master count control snapping back to previous value, replacing SpinBox with SettingsSlider.
- **Aspect ratio menu**: Replace flat menu items with nested submenu for aspect ratio presets.
- **Layer-shell window recovery**: Recover shader preview when the Wayland `LayerSurface` is unexpectedly destroyed.

### Migration Notes (Packagers)
- Drop `layer-shell-qt` / `liblayershellqtinterface-dev` build dependency
- Add `qt6-wayland` / `qt6-wayland-dev` build dependency
- Add `wayland-scanner` build dependency (usually in `wayland-devel`)
- Add `vulkan-headers` and `vulkan-loader` build dependencies (optional, for Vulkan backend)

## [2.4.7] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Center-distance zone selection for overlapping zones** ([#258]): When zones overlap (e.g. quadrants + halves + fullscreen), the zone whose center is closest to the cursor now wins instead of always picking the smallest zone. This lets users reach background zones by dragging toward their center, matching the FancyZones behavior. The multi-zone span path is unaffected, preserving the [#211] fix.

### Fixed
- **Window picker inserts unmatchable values** ([#251]): "Pick from running windows" in App Rules and Exclusions inserted raw X11 window class format (e.g. `"signal signal"`) instead of the normalized form used for matching (`"signal"`). Manually typing the name worked. Using the picker did not.
- **Keyboard shortcuts move excluded windows** ([#251]): Move, Push, and Swap keyboard shortcuts ignored exclusion rules, moving the window behind an excluded app instead of doing nothing. All navigation shortcuts now check exclusions consistently.
- **Drag-out unsnap doesn't clear persisted zone** ([#251]): Dragging a window out of its zone and closing it would still persist the zone, causing the window to snap back on reopen. The floating state flag was not always set due to an overly strict guard condition.
- **D-Bus zone detection missing geometry recalculation**: `detectMultiZoneAtPosition` did not call `recalculateZoneGeometries` before detection, potentially using stale zone coordinates.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Plasma Sigil shader**: Animated energy sigil based on the PlasmaZones icon with glowing rune effects.

### Fixed
- **System Settings crash when opening PlasmaZones KCM**: The KCM linked the entire `plasmazones_core` library (with layer-shell QPA plugin, PlasmaActivities, 21 static initializers) just to read a version string. When the daemon was not running this caused heap corruption and SIGABRT during QML binding creation. Replaced with a compile-time version define so the KCM no longer loads the core library at all.
- **Editor context menu crash on zone updates**: Use shared context menu to prevent QQmlData use-after-free crash when zones update while the menu is open.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **SVG support for shader textures**: SVG/SVGZ files can now be used as user texture parameters in shaders, rasterized at configurable resolution (64–4096px, default 1024) via `QSvgRenderer`. An inline resolution spinbox appears in the shader settings UI when an SVG is selected.

### Fixed
- **Exclusions UI: can't add new entries** ([#251]): The QML JS array mutation pattern (`slice()` + `push()` + reassign) silently fails in Qt 6.10 due to `QStringList`↔JS Array round-trip type confusion. Replaced with `Q_INVOKABLE` C++ methods that modify the `QStringList` directly and emit proper `NOTIFY` signals.
- **Excluded app keyboard shortcuts: no feedback** ([#251]): Snap-to-zone shortcuts blocked by exclusion rules now emit OSD feedback instead of failing silently.
- **Neon Phantom shader white-out**: Reduced brightness multipliers and widened energy smoothstep range to prevent the effect from blowing out to featureless white at high energy accumulation.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Identical monitors showing as duplicates in settings** ([#252]): Two monitors with the same EDID (manufacturer/model/serial) got the same screen ID, causing the settings UI to show the primary monitor twice and tiling/snapping to only work on one monitor. Screen IDs now append `/ConnectorName` when duplicates are detected, with backward-compatible fallback matching for saved configs.
- **App-to-Zone rules not working** ([#254]): Rule matching used raw substring comparison that failed when appId format differed from user input (e.g. "firefox" vs "org.mozilla.firefox"). Replaced with `appIdMatches()`, segment-aware dot-boundary matching that handles both directions and partial last-segment prefixes.
- **Exclusions ignored by auto-snap and keyboard shortcuts** ([#254]): The exclusion settings interface existed but was never checked. Added exclusion gates in both the auto-snap chain (`resolveWindowRestore`) and keyboard shortcut path (`snapToZoneByNumber`).
- **Unsnapped windows re-snap on reopen** ([#254]): Manually unsnapping a window didn't clear its pending restore entry, so closing and reopening it snapped it back. Now consumes the pending entry on unsnap (multi-instance safe).
- **Drag-out unsnap doesn't restore window size** ([#254]): The geometry validation path didn't pass the release screen ID, causing cross-screen coordinate validation to fail silently. Also fixed premature pre-tile geometry cleanup that prevented later float-toggle restore.
- **Render node use-after-free during hot-reload**: The scene graph render thread could dereference a dangling `QQuickItem` pointer after shader hot-reload when `bufferFeedback` (ping-pong) was active. Added atomic invalidation flag with acquire/release ordering.

### Added
- **Ember Trace shader**: Fractal fire patterns via ping-pong feedback buffer, the first shader to use the `bufferFeedback` feature. Zone borders emit flames that spiral inward via feedback zoom, with 7 layered visual systems including reaction-diffusion-like dynamics, curl-noise advection, and per-band audio (bass eruption shockwaves, mids feedback phase shift, treble turbulent mixing).
- **Neon Phantom shader**: Neon-lit cyberpunk zone overlay.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Multi-zone span pulls in background zones** ([#249]): Spanning adjacent sub-zones (e.g. zones 7 & 9) while a larger zone existed underneath incorrectly included the background zone, making the window much larger than intended. Fixed both proximity-snap and paint-to-span code paths to exclude background/overlay zones from the span.
- **Settings UI not refreshing when daemon starts from toggle**: UI data now reloads when the daemon is started via the settings toggle.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Edge threshold resets to 100px** ([#237]): The UI allowed up to 500px but the C++ setter/loader still clamped to 100. Values above 100 were silently clamped back on save. Also fixed the `.kcfg` schema max to match.
- **Per-screen autotile split ratio using wrong default**: Per-screen overrides fell back to the algorithm default (0.6) instead of the config default (0.5) when no override was stored.
- **Shortcuts KCM shows "plasmazonesd" with no icon**: Added KGlobalAccel component desktop file and restored `setApplicationDisplayName`/`setWindowIcon` lost during KAboutData removal.
- **Retile shortcut conflicts with Spectacle**: Changed default from Meta+Shift+R (Spectacle rectangular region capture) to Meta+Ctrl+R.

### Changed
- **ConfigDefaults is now the single source of truth** for all setting defaults, min/max bounds, and shortcut defaults. Previously duplicated across `configdefaults.h`, `settings.h`, `setters.cpp`, `loadsave.cpp`, `perscreen.cpp`, QML pages, `.kcfg`, and tests. Now every consumer references `ConfigDefaults`. Changing a bound or default requires editing exactly one place.
- **Settings bounds exposed to QML** via `SettingsController` constant Q_PROPERTYs. All QML `from:`/`to:` values reference the controller instead of hardcoded literals.
- **Removed dead code**: Unused `ZoneSelectorCard.qml`.
- **Added `FilterLayoutsByAspectRatio` to `.kcfg`**: Was implemented in code but missing from the schema.
- **Editor defaults consolidated**: Previously hardcoded in `loadsave.cpp`, now in `ConfigDefaults`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **KZones layout import** ([PR #244]): Import zone layouts from KZones configuration files.
- **Aspect ratio layouts** ([PR #242]): Auto-detect monitor aspect ratio, editor selector for ratio-specific layouts, and filter setting for the layout grid.
- **Portable Wayland build** ([PR #231]): `USE_KDE_FRAMEWORKS=ON/OFF` CMake option. Pluggable backends for config (`IConfigBackend`), shortcuts (`IShortcutBackend`), wallpaper (`IWallpaperProvider`), and i18n (Qt Linguist). Runs on non-KDE Wayland compositors.
- **Standalone settings app** ([PR #238]): `plasmazones-settings` with KCM-style sidebar drill-down, subpages, visual monitor selector, search, keyboard shortcuts overlay, unsaved-changes indicator, and DPI-aware animations. Meta+Shift+P shortcut to launch.
- **D-Bus API audit** ([PR #246]): New `CompositorBridge`, `Control`, and `Shader` interfaces. Convenience methods and full API specification. Unit tests for all new methods.
- **Arch Drift branded shader**: Terminal rain columns, isometric chevron grid, traveling data packets, and CRT scan lines. 95-vertex SDF polygon from the official Crystal SVG.
- **EndeavourOS Drift branded shader**: Constellation network background with 24 dots on Lissajous orbits, warm gradient wash, and tri-sail SDF logo (58 vertices total).
- **Wind currents + sails shader**: Replaced constellation network with flowing wind current effect.

### Changed
- **KWin effect reduced to thin interface layer** ([PR #245]): Effect code is now a minimal bridge between KWin and the daemon over D-Bus. All tiling/snapping logic lives in the daemon.
- **Removed unused `LayoutType` enum**: Cleaned up `Layout` model. The `type` field was never used.
- **Dropped `IConfigBackend` interface indirection**: `QSettingsConfigBackend` used directly after KConfig removal stabilized.
- **Removed KConfig dependency from test suite**: Tests use the standalone config backend.
- **Removed daemon toggle from KCM**: Moved `DaemonController` to `src/common`.

### Fixed
- **Synchronous D-Bus calls freeze compositor**: Eliminated blocking D-Bus calls in the KWin effect that caused compositor hangs.
- **Qt6 SIGSEGV in context menu**: Moved context menu outside `Loader` to avoid crash.
- **Qt6 crash in aspect ratio submenu**: Flattened submenu to avoid nested popup crash.
- **Tooltip flickering on layout cards in Flow layout** ([#235]): Fixed hover handler conflicts.
- **Zone previews clamped for fixed-geometry layouts**: Preview rendering no longer overflows card bounds.
- **Edge threshold max increased**: From 100px to 500px.
- **Settings live lock sync and screenId resolution**: OSD lock state now syncs immediately.
- **EndeavourOS Drift GLSL type errors**: Fixed vec2/float mismatches and wired dead parameters.
- **Shader file watcher dropped after cmake install**: Re-watches directories after inode replacement.
- **Layout card icon hover flicker** ([#235]): Replaced `HoverHandler` with `MouseArea` to fix grab conflicts.

## [2.3.16] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Layout card button flicker on hover** ([#235]): The Auto-assign and Visibility toggle buttons flickered when hovered. There were two cooperating causes. First, the right-anchored Row reflowed leftward when buttons toggled `visible:`, shifting button positions and destabilizing hover. Second, `ToolTip.visible: hovered` with no delay opened a popup that stole pointer focus on some compositors. Wrapped each ToolButton in a fixed-size Item to eliminate geometry reflow and added `ToolTip.delay` to break the feedback loop.
- **Zone selector grid ignoring columns/rows at fixed preview sizes**: The `maxRows` setting was only applied when preview size was "Auto". Fixed to apply for all size modes in Grid layout.

### Changed
- **Improved zone selector edge scrolling**: Widened auto-scroll trigger zone from 32px to 48px and increased max scroll speed by 75% for more responsive scrolling during window drag.
- **Zone selector scroll D-Bus API**: Added `selectorScrollWheel` D-Bus method and `applyScrollDelta` QML function for programmatic scrolling. Infrastructure is wired and ready for when KWin exposes pointer axis events to effects.

## [2.3.15] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Shader preview crash on hover** ([#235]): Moving the mouse over the shader preview in the editor dialog crashed with SIGSEGV in `QV4::Lookup::getterQObject`. The `MouseArea.onPositionChanged` handler's QObject-backed event parameter was invalidated mid-evaluation by cascading signal chains on Qt 6.10. Replaced `MouseArea` with `HoverHandler` which uses a value-type point property.
- **CAVA settings not applied dynamically**: Enabling/disabling CAVA audio visualizer or changing bar count/sample rate in KCM required a daemon restart. The KCM's batch `setSettings` applied values with `QSignalBlocker`, then `load()` saw no change (in-memory values already updated). Added `syncCavaState()` called from `updateSettings()` on every settings reload.
- **Layout card button flicker at fractional DPI**: The Auto-assign and Visibility toggle buttons flickered when hovered at 125% display scaling. The `visible:` property toggling caused Row geometry reflow that shifted button positions by sub-pixel amounts, creating a hover feedback loop. Replaced `visible:` with `opacity:`/`enabled:` and added `ToolTip.delay`.

### Changed
- **Enhanced label effects for branded shaders**: CachyOS, Fedora, Neon, and NixOS Drift shaders had label text bodies that appeared solid white. Text fill patterns used screen-space UV which barely varied within characters, and `smoothstep(0.3, 0.9, labels.a)` washed to white. Rewrote all four with pixel-space patterns, edge rim detection, and `x/(0.6+x)` tonemapping. Each shader gets a unique style. Digital shatter (CachyOS), frost crystalline (Fedora), neon tube flicker (Neon), hash grid verification (NixOS).

## [2.3.14] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Flickering icons on layout card hover** ([#235]): The visibility and auto-assign toggle icons in the KCM layouts grid flickered when hovering over them. The `ToolButton` controls stole hover from the underlying `MouseArea`, causing a containsMouse feedback loop. Replaced `MouseArea` hover tracking with a `HoverHandler` which doesn't lose hover state when child controls intercept mouse events.

## [2.3.13] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Resnap buffer empty on layout change**: Cycling layouts, using the layout picker, or selecting from the zone selector never resnapped windows to the new layout's zones. `UnifiedLayoutController::applyEntry()` blocks `activeLayoutChanged` via `QSignalBlocker`, which prevented `onLayoutChanged()` from populating the resnap buffer. All layout change paths now explicitly populate the buffer via `populateResnapBufferForAllScreens()` before resnapping.
- **Per-screen mode toggle and layout cycle scoped to target screen**: Mode toggle (autotile/snapping) and layout cycling now correctly operate on the focused screen only, rather than affecting the global active layout state for all screens.

### Changed
- **Unified layout change resnap path**: Layout picker, zone selector, cycle, and quick-layout shortcuts all route through `resnapIfManualMode()` instead of using separate inline resnap logic. Eliminates duplicate code and ensures consistent resnap behavior across all layout change entry points.
- **Renamed screenName variables to screenId/connectorName**: Internal refactor for consistent naming of screen identifiers throughout the codebase.

## [2.3.12] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **EDID serial mismatch between effect and daemon**: KWin 6's `Output::serialNumber()` returns the EDID text serial descriptor (e.g. `HNTY800697`), while Qt's `QScreen::serialNumber()` returns the EDID header serial (e.g. `810700097`). This caused the daemon to fail screen lookups for IDs received from the KWin effect. `findScreenByIdOrName` now falls back to manufacturer + model matching when serials differ and there's exactly one screen of that make/model.

## [2.3.11] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Move/Swap hotkeys on dual same-model monitors**: On setups with two identical-model monitors (e.g. dual Samsung Odyssey G93SC with different serials), KWin's `EffectWindow::screen()` can return the wrong output. Navigation hotkeys now trust the daemon's stored screen assignment for snapped windows (set at snap time, always correct) and fall back to the effect-provided screen only for unsnapped windows. Cross-screen moves are handled by `outputChanged` → `windowScreenChanged` which unsnaps the window before navigation fires.

## [2.3.10] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Move/Swap hotkeys use wrong screen's layout**: When a window was moved between monitors externally (KDE's Move-to-Screen shortcut, manual drag racing with `outputChanged`), keyboard navigation hotkeys used the stored screen assignment instead of the window's actual screen, snapping the window back to the old monitor or computing zone geometry from the wrong layout. Now always uses the effect-provided screen (`EffectWindow::screen()`) and detects stale assignments: if the stored screen differs from the actual screen, treats the window as unsnapped and navigates from scratch on the correct screen's layout.

## [2.3.9] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Modifier key settings zeroed on save**: Changing the activation modifier in the KCM and saving silently wrote all-zero triggers to KConfig, permanently disabling zone activation. Complex D-Bus types (`QVariantList` of `QVariantMap`s) arrived as `QDBusArgument` objects that `toList()`/`toMap()` couldn't extract. Now applies `DBusVariantUtils::convertDbusArgument()` in both `setSetting()` and `setSettings()` before passing values to setters. Affects `dragActivationTriggers`, `zoneSpanTriggers`, and `snapAssistTriggers`.

## [2.3.8] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Batch settings D-Bus method**: New `setSettings(QVariantMap)` method applies multiple settings in one D-Bus call with a single KConfig save. Complete settings registry with 87 entries covering all autotile, zone selector, shortcut, and behavior settings.
- **Per-screen settings D-Bus methods**: New `setPerScreenSetting`/`clearPerScreenSettings`/`getPerScreenSettings` D-Bus methods for autotile, snapping, and zone selector categories. Per-screen calls use async D-Bus to avoid blocking the KCM UI during slider interactions.
- **Zone previews in autotile dropdowns**: Autotile algorithm dropdowns now show layout thumbnails with zone previews, matching the snapping layout dropdown UX.

### Changed
- **Daemon is sole KConfig writer**: All KCM settings writes now route through D-Bus to the daemon. No KCM sub-page calls `m_settings->save()` directly. Eliminates dual-writer race conditions between the KCM and daemon.
- **Batch signal suppression**: `setSettings()` wraps setter calls in `QSignalBlocker` to prevent N intermediate `settingsChanged` emissions mid-batch. The KCM's `notifyReload()` triggers a single `settingsChanged` with all values committed.

### Fixed
- **Mode toggle affects all monitors**: `Meta+Shift+T` autotile toggle now only affects the focused screen's context. Previously, `seedAutotileOrderForScreen` and the resnap-from-autotile-order loop processed all screens instead of the shortcut's target screen.
- **Clearing autotile algorithm to "Use default" switches to snapping mode**: `activeLayoutId()` now returns `"autotile:"` (recognized by `isAutotile()`) when mode is Autotile with empty algorithm, instead of returning empty string which caused `updateAutotileScreens` to drop the screen from autotile.
- **showBorder and hideTitleBars are independent toggles**: Turning off borders no longer forces title bars to reappear. Turning on hideTitleBars now immediately hides title bars on all currently tiled windows instead of waiting for the next retile.
- **KCM save ordering for per-screen overrides**: `setDaemonSettings()` now runs before `m_settings->save()` so per-screen overrides written by the KCM are not overwritten by the daemon's stale values.
- **Navigation fallback screen**: Fall back to the KWin effect's screen when the daemon's stored screen assignment is gone, preventing navigation failures after monitor reconfiguration.

## [2.3.7] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Windows unsnap when monitor enters standby**: When a monitor (e.g., a TV) entered standby or disconnected, KWin reassigned orphaned windows to remaining outputs, firing `outputChanged` signals. The effect interpreted these as cross-screen moves and told the daemon to unsnap every affected window. Now suppresses `windowScreenChanged` when the old screen has disappeared from KWin's output list or a screen geometry change is in progress.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Navigation shortcuts snap to wrong screen on multi-monitor**: MoveWindow and SwapWindow keyboard shortcuts computed zone geometry for the wrong screen when KWin's `EffectWindow::screen()` disagreed with the daemon's stored screen assignment (common with similarly-named monitors like dual Samsung Odyssey G93SC ultrawides). The window would land on a third screen and immediately unsnap. Navigation targets now use the daemon's authoritative stored screen assignment, and the effect reads the corrected screen from the daemon's response.

### Added
- **KDE dependency migration plan**: `docs/kde-dependency-migration.md` documents how to make the daemon portable across Wayland compositors (GNOME, Hyprland, Sway) while retaining full KDE integration, behind a `USE_KDE_FRAMEWORKS` CMake option.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **KCM assignment save rewrites modes**: The KCM decomposed per-screen AssignmentEntry (mode + snappingLayout + tilingAlgorithm) into two flat maps and merged them on save, losing mode information, reverting layouts after Apply, and corrupting autotile/snapping mode when editing the other mode's field. Replaced with per-entry D-Bus writes via new `setAssignmentEntry` method that preserves all fields independently.
- **Clearing per-desktop override inherits base autotile mode**: Setting a per-desktop layout to "Use default" removed the entire entry, inheriting the base screen's mode (often autotile). Now keeps a mode-only marker entry that preserves the desktop's mode while cascading layout resolution to the parent scope.
- **Monitor-level layout changes revert after Apply**: The batch `setAllScreenAssignments` D-Bus method used `fromLayoutId(id, existing)` which preserved the old mode instead of setting it from the layout ID type. Combined with the merge logic sending the wrong mode's ID, screens appeared to revert.
- **KCM combo shows resolved layout instead of "Use default"**: After clearing a per-desktop assignment, the combo showed the inherited layout name instead of "Use default" because the D-Bus echo signal overwrote the KCM cache with the cascaded base layout. Added `setSaveBatchMode` to suppress `screenLayoutChanged` signals during the entire save batch.
- **Layout cascade stops at mode-only entries**: `layoutForScreen` returned nullptr immediately when finding a mode-only entry (empty snapping in Snapping mode) instead of cascading to the parent scope. Now continues cascading through mode-only entries to find the effective layout.

### Added
- **Resnap/retile on KCM assignment changes**: Changing layouts via KCM assignments now triggers window resnap (snapping) or retile (autotile) with per-screen OSD, matching the behavior of the layout picker overlay and keyboard shortcuts. Uses dedicated `applyAssignmentChanges` D-Bus method to avoid feedback loops with the settings handler.
- **Per-screen resnap buffer**: New `populateResnapBufferForAllScreens` method builds resnap data using a global zoneId-to-position map from all loaded layouts, independent of the single global active layout. Supports multi-monitor setups where each screen has a different layout assignment.
- **Synchronous notifyReload**: KCM-to-daemon settings reload is now synchronous with `m_ignoreNextSettingsChanged` flag, preventing race conditions where the daemon's queued `settingsChanged` signal would trigger a spurious reload that reverts just-saved assignments.

### Changed
- **Assignment edits never change mode**: Selecting a snapping layout or tiling algorithm in the KCM only updates that field. Mode is controlled exclusively by the daemon through global snapping/autotile toggle, not by individual assignment edits.
- **Full AssignmentEntry tracking in KCM**: Replaced redundant flat pending maps (`m_pendingDesktopAssignments`, `m_pendingActivityAssignments`) with full `AssignmentEntry` pending maps that track mode + snappingLayout + tilingAlgorithm per context.
- **Field-level clearing**: Clearing a snapping layout only clears the `snappingLayout` field, preserving mode and `tilingAlgorithm`. Prevents unintended mode inheritance from parent scopes.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Autotile not activating when snapping disabled first**: When users disabled snapping (Apply) then enabled autotiling (Apply) in separate steps, per-screen autotile assignments were never created because the activation guard required both changes in the same settings event. Windows fell through to fullscreen stacking instead of tiling. Now also fires when autotile is toggled on while snapping is already off.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Batched D-Bus signals for autotile transitions**: Overflow float notifications, resnap snap confirmations, and window-opened announcements are now batched into single D-Bus calls instead of per-window round-trips. On a 15-window autotile toggle this reduces D-Bus messages from ~45 to 3, eliminating compositor-thread stalls during mode switches and daemon restarts.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Window state lost on daemon reload**: Zone assignments were purged during `loadState()` when the saved active layout differed from the default layout. Restoring the active layout emitted `activeLayoutChanged` before `currentVirtualDesktop` was set, causing `onLayoutChanged()` to resolve effective layouts against the wrong desktop and fall back to `defaultLayout()`, whose zones didn't match the saved assignments. Fixed by suppressing the signal during state restoration.
- **Screen not found on Wayland (hex serial mismatch)**: The daemon's `screenIdentifier()` used `QScreen::serialNumber()` as-is, but on KDE Plasma Wayland this returns the EDID header serial in hex (e.g., `"0x0001C1A3"`). The KWin effect already normalized to decimal (`"115107"`), causing screen ID mismatches across the D-Bus boundary. Both sides now produce identical decimal serials.
- **Screen not found from KCM queries ([#223])**: `getScreenInfo()` only matched screens by connector name (`"eDP-1"`), but `getScreens()` returns EDID-based screen IDs (`"Sharp Corporation:LQ134N1JW53"`). Every KCM screen info query failed, causing autotile assignments to revert and persistent "screen not found" errors on multi-monitor setups. Now accepts both connector names and screen IDs.
- **Autotile window order lost on rapid mode toggle**: When `setInitialWindowOrder()` was called twice for the same screen, the first call's 10-second safety timer would fire and remove the second call's pending order. Added a generation counter so stale timers from superseded calls become no-ops.
- **KCM fallback screen IDs inconsistent**: When the daemon was unavailable, the KCM screen provider fell back to connector names instead of EDID-based screen IDs, causing per-screen config mismatches. Now uses `Utils::screenIdentifier()` in the fallback path.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Stable EDID-based screen identifiers**: All screen identification now uses stable EDID-based IDs (e.g., `LG Electronics:LG Ultra HD:115107`) instead of connector names (`DP-2`). Monitors survive replug/reboot without losing layout assignments.
- **Per-screen layout filtering**: Layout cycle shortcuts, layout picker popup, and zone selector now filter layouts based on the focused screen's mode. Snapping screens only show zone layouts. Autotile screens only show tiling algorithms.
- **Per-screen layout locking**: Lock the current layout or tiling algorithm per screen/desktop/activity context. Prevents accidental changes from layout cycling, zone selector, or keyboard shortcuts. Toggle with `Meta+Ctrl+L` shortcut. OSD notification shows lock/unlock state.
- **Per-mode context-aware locking**: Locking is mode-aware. Locking on a snapping screen locks the zone layout, and locking on an autotile screen locks the tiling algorithm. Each screen/desktop combination has independent lock state.
- **Shader parameter locking**: Lock individual shader parameters in the editor to preserve their values during randomize. Locked parameters show a lock icon and are excluded from random generation.
- **Quick Layout slot labels**: KCM now shows "Quick Layout 1" / "Quick Tiling 1" instead of raw shortcut keys (`Meta+Alt+1`). Shortcut key shown as secondary text.
- **Hot reload for shaders**: System and user shaders reload automatically on file changes.

### Fixed
- **Snap assist sending windows to wrong monitor**: On dual-monitor setups sharing the same layout, zones occupied on one screen appeared occupied on the other. Empty zone detection is now per-screen.
- **Cross-screen drag not clearing snap/float state**: Dragging a snapped window to a different monitor now clears the zone assignment and pre-tile geometry. Float toggle no longer restores to the original monitor.
- **Window restore unsnapping on cross-screen restore**: Windows persisted on a secondary monitor would immediately unsnap after restore. The daemon now decides whether to unsnap based on its own assignment state.
- **Snap assist flashing during rapid layout cycling**: Snap assist continuation now runs after stagger animations complete, with a generation counter to invalidate stale callbacks from previous layouts.
- **Zone selector showing on autotile-managed screens**: The zone selector popup now correctly skips screens in autotile mode.

### Changed
- **Screen ID migration**: 34+ files refactored to use EDID-based screen IDs consistently across the entire effect↔daemon D-Bus boundary, autotile engine, snap engine, and window tracking service.
- **Shader categories from metadata**: Removed hardcoded category translations. Category names come directly from shader `metadata.json`.
- **German translations**: All three domains 100% complete (KCM: 529, Editor: 449, Daemon: 61).

## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Primary screen detection on Wayland**: `QGuiApplication::primaryScreen()` could diverge from KDE Display Settings on some multi-monitor Wayland configurations. The KWin effect now queries `Workspace::outputOrder()` (the compositor's authoritative output priority) and pushes the true primary to the daemon via D-Bus. Updates automatically when display settings change.

### Changed
- **Complete German translations**: All three translation domains are now 100% translated (KCM: 520, Editor: 446, Daemon: 61 strings).
- **Translation extraction fix**: Sub-KCM QML files were missing from pot extraction (glob only scanned `kcm/ui/`, not `kcm/*/ui/`).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Independent border and title bar toggles** (fixes [#210](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/210)): New "Show focus border" setting draws a colored border around the focused tiled window without requiring title bars to be hidden. Border width, corner radius, and color are configurable independently.
- **Border corner radius setting**: New corner radius option (0–20px) for the autotile focus border. For borderless windows, the window content is clipped to match the rounded border.
- **Right-click context menu for layouts**: Edit, Set as Default, Show/Hide from Zone Selector, Enable/Disable Auto-assign, Duplicate, Export, and Delete actions are now accessible via right-click on layout cards. The toolbar has been simplified to New Layout, Import, Open Folder, and view switching.
- **Monitor selector for layout editor**: Layouts KCM now shows a screen selector (multi-monitor setups) so the editor opens on the correct monitor instead of always using the first screen.

### Fixed
- **Double toggle-float on multi-monitor setups**: Navigation signal connections were registered twice (constructor + daemon ready), causing float toggle and other shortcuts to fire their handlers twice and immediately cancel themselves.
- **Snap-mode zone changes leaking into autotile engine**: The autotile engine's `windowZoneChanged` listener incorrectly called `onWindowAdded()` for snap-mode windows, triggering "not in m_windowToStateKey" warnings and potentially inserting windows into the wrong screen's tiling state.
- **Window tiling state preserved when moved to another desktop**: Moving a tiled window to a different virtual desktop now properly removes it from the source desktop's tiling and retiles to fill the gap. Title bars are restored for borderless windows.
- **Editor opens on wrong monitor** (fixes [#216](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/216)): The Layouts KCM always sent the editor to the first screen in the list. Now uses user selection, falling back to the primary monitor.
- **"Open Layouts Folder" error on fresh install** (fixes [#216](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/216)): The layouts directory is now created if it doesn't exist before opening.
- **Layout grid not refreshing after duplicate/delete/import**: The daemon never emitted layout change D-Bus signals, so the KCM grid relied on manual reloads. Added `scheduleLoad()` after all mutating operations.
- **QML compiler warning in layout editor**: Fixed `threshold` variable used before declaration in `DividerManager.qml`.
- **Update check button spacing**: Increased padding between the "Check for Updates" button and the result message.

### Changed
- **KCM layout reorganization**: Autotiling settings split into Appearance (Colors, Decorations, Focus Border) and Behavior cards. Snapping "Snapping Behavior" card renamed to "Behavior" for consistency.
- **Enable toggles restyled**: Snapping and Tiling enable toggles now use the same bold-label + switch pattern as the main "Enable PlasmaZones" toggle.
- **Layout toolbar simplified**: Per-layout actions moved to right-click context menu. Toolbar retains only global actions (New Layout, Import, Open Folder, view switcher).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Breaking Changes
- **Assignment storage migrated from JSON to KConfig**: Per-screen layout assignments (snapping layout and tiling algorithm) are now stored in `plasmazonesrc` KConfig groups (`[Assignment:*]`) instead of `assignments.json`. Existing `assignments.json` files are automatically migrated on first startup and renamed to `assignments.json.migrated`.

### Added
- **Per-desktop/activity tiling state isolation** (fixes [#212](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/212)): Each virtual desktop and activity now maintains independent tiling state (window membership, master count, split ratios, floating state). Switching desktops no longer interferes with tiling on other desktops.
- **Zone shaders**: Added Fedora Drift, NixOS Drift, openSUSE Drift, and KDE Neon gear zone shaders

### Fixed
- **Editor: new zones could not reach canvas edges during drag** (fixes [#215](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/215)): Grid-aligned snap clamping prevented zones from reaching canvas boundaries, and gap calculation used stale data during drag operations
- **Login freeze from startup OSD**: Prevented OSD from blocking the D-Bus event loop during daemon startup

### Changed
- **KCM refactored into sub-KCMs**: Split into Layouts, Snapping, Tiling, Shortcuts, Apps & Windows, and About sub-modules with a shared common library

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Missing `retileAllScreens` D-Bus slot**: KWin effect called `retileAllScreens` but the adaptor only exposed `retile(screenName)`, causing D-Bus errors on border width changes and other bulk retile triggers
- **Negative zone geometries from constraint solver**: When window minimum sizes exceed available space, the constraint solver could produce non-positive zone dimensions, now clamped to minimum 1x1 after layout calculation

### Changed
- **Generic tarball built on Arch Linux**: Switched the release pipeline's generic tarball build from Fedora 43 to Arch Linux, eliminating lib64/lib path mismatches at the source instead of working around them post-build

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Arch lib64 file conflict with generic tarball** (fixes [#203](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/203)): Force `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib` in the generic tarball build so it doesn't inherit Fedora's `lib64` default, which conflicts with Arch's `filesystem` package owning `/usr/lib64` as a symlink
- **Global show-zone-numbers toggle ignored when layout active** (fixes [#208](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/208)): Changed zone number visibility so the global toggle is a master switch. Per-layout setting can only further restrict, not override it
- **Easing preset dropdown UX** (fixes [#207](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/207)): Replaced single 30+ item flat dropdown with two-dropdown Style + Direction selector, and clamped elastic/bounce preview animation to prevent overshoot overflow
- **Modifier key capture silently broken by qmlformat** (fixes [#205](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/205)): Replaced large Qt::KeyboardModifier integer literals with bit-shift expressions (`1 << 25` etc.) that qmlformat cannot mangle into lossy scientific notation
- **Fedora COPR repo name case sensitivity**: Fixed COPR repo reference to use correct casing

### Added
- **Fedora COPR and openSUSE OBS install instructions** in README (fixes [#209](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/209))

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

#### Autotiling Engine
- **Pluggable algorithm architecture** with 10 tiling layouts: Master+Stack, Centered Master, BSP, Dwindle, Spiral, Columns, Rows, Grid, Wide, Three-Column, and Monocle
- **Per-screen algorithm selection** with independent settings per monitor
- **Separate centered-master settings**: Split ratio and master count are independent from master+stack (defaults: 0.5 vs 0.6)
- **Per-screen maxWindows cap** to limit tiled window count per monitor
- **Per-side outer gaps** (top/bottom/left/right) for independent screen edge spacing
- **Overflow window management**: Auto-float excess windows when maxWindows is reached, auto-recover when room opens
- **Hide title bars** on tiled windows with configurable active-window border rendering (color, width)
- **Deterministic zone-ordered window transitions** when switching between snapping and autotiling modes
- **Float/unfloat toggle** with geometry preservation and cross-screen fallback
- **Smart gaps**, insert position config, focus-follows-mouse, focus-new-windows
- **Minimum window size** respect with algorithm-level constraint solving
- **D-Bus interface** (`org.plasmazones.Autotile`) for runtime control
- **Read-only preview mode** for autotile layouts in the editor
- **Pre-autotile geometry persistence** across session restarts for accurate float restore

#### Animation System
- **Translate-only slide animations** that avoid Wayland buffer desync (no scale transforms)
- **Staggered cascading window animations** with configurable overlap
- **Cubic bezier easing curve editor** in KCM with live preview
- **Elastic and bounce easing curve types** with customizable parameters (amplitude, period, overshoot)

#### KCM Improvements
- **Dual-view layout picker** with separate Snapping/Tiling modes and default autotile algorithm selection
- **Dual-mode per-screen assignments** (snapping layouts + autotile algorithms per monitor)
- **Snapping enable/disable toggle**
- **Auto-select default layout** in Layout tab
- **Live algorithm preview widget**
- **Per-monitor snapping gap/padding overrides**

### Changed
- **Renamed Zones tab to Snapping** in KCM for clarity alongside the new Tiling tab
- **BSP algorithm made deterministic**: Removed persistent tree state that caused non-reproducible layouts
- **Major codebase refactoring**: Split 20+ oversized files (>500 lines) into DRY translation units organized in subdirectories
  - Extracted `OverflowManager`, `PerScreenConfigResolver`, `NavigationController`, `SettingsBridge` from `AutotileEngine`
  - Extracted `AssignmentManager`, `DaemonController`, `LayoutManager` from monolithic KCM
  - Extracted `AutotileHandler`, `ScreenChangeHandler`, `SnapAssistHandler` from KWin effect
  - Split `Settings`, `OverlayService`, `WindowTrackingService`, D-Bus adaptors, and editor into subdirectories
- **Comprehensive unit tests** for all algorithms, engine, tiling state, overflow manager, geometry utils, and algorithm registry (11 test suites)

## [1.15.15] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Shortcuts not working until window is manually snapped**: The async D-Bus key grab refactor (v1.15.14) bypassed `KGlobalAccel::setShortcut()`, which connects to the component's `globalShortcutPressed` D-Bus signal. Without this connection, key grabs succeeded but press events were never received. Fixed by bootstrapping the component signal with one synchronous `setShortcut()` call (~490ms) before firing async D-Bus for the remaining ~50 key grabs.

## [1.15.14] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Nix build failure after systemd service template change**: Removed stale `postInstall` `substituteInPlace` that tried to replace `/usr/bin/plasmazonesd` in the systemd service file. Since the service now uses `configure_file(@ONLY)` with `@KDE_INSTALL_FULL_BINDIR@`, the path resolves correctly at build time and no post-install patching is needed.

## [1.15.13] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Login freeze with many shortcuts** (fixes [#200](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/200)): Replaced blocking `KGlobalAccel::setGlobalShortcut()` with a two-step approach where `setDefaultShortcut()` registers all shortcuts without key grabs, then async D-Bus calls activate key grabs in parallel without blocking the event loop. Eliminates 20-40s hangs during login when kglobalacceld is under contention.

## [1.15.12] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Global shortcuts broken after v1.15.9/v1.15.10** (fixes [#200](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/200)): Reverted async D-Bus shortcut registration (v1.15.10) and deferred batching (v1.15.9) which left the KGlobalAccel component inactive, preventing all shortcut dispatch. Restored direct `KGlobalAccel::setGlobalShortcut()` calls which properly register actions and set up key grabs through the official API.

## [1.15.11] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Release workflow retry loop**: Replaced `softprops/action-gh-release` with native `gh` CLI to fix releases getting stuck in a retry loop ([action-gh-release#704](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/issues/704)).

## [1.15.10] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Login freeze persisted despite v1.15.9 batching** (fixes [#200](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/200)): The v1.15.9 deferred batch approach still blocked because each batch made synchronous D-Bus round-trips whose replies stalled for ~25s while kglobalaccel processed key grabs (QTBUG-34698). Replaced with true async D-Bus. `setDefaultShortcut()` registers actions synchronously (fast, no key grabbing), then `setShortcutKeys` calls fire via `QDBusPendingCallWatcher` so the event loop never blocks on key grabbing.

## [1.15.9] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Login freeze with autostart apps** (fixes [#200](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/200)): Shortcut registration made 86+ synchronous D-Bus calls to KGlobalAccel at startup, blocking the event loop for 20-40 seconds when competing with other KDE services during login. Registration is now batched and deferred, yielding the event loop between batches.
- **systemd service ordering**: Added `After=plasma-kglobalaccel.service` to ensure the shortcut daemon is ready before PlasmaZones registers shortcuts.

## [1.15.8] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **RPM: remove exact KWin version pin** (fixes [#199](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones/discussions/199)): RPM package required `kwin = <build-version>` which blocked installation when KWin received patch updates (e.g. 6.6.1 -> 6.6.2). Changed to `kwin >= 6.6.0`. Soname-level deps handle ABI safety automatically.

## [1.15.7] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **KWin 6.6.2 compatibility**: Rebuild for KWin 6.6.2 minor release. Effect plugin is version-locked and requires exact KWin version match to load.

## [1.15.6] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Debian package build**: Re-enabled .deb creation using KDE Neon container (`kdeneon/all:dev-stable`) which ships Plasma/KF6 6.6+, replacing the disabled Ubuntu 25.10 build.

## [1.15.5] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Multi-zone snap cascade in tiling layouts**: Edge-adjacent detection no longer flood-fill expands through shared edges, which caused all zones to highlight in tiling layouts. Seed zones are now used directly for multi-zone snap. Bounding-rect expansion is retained only for paint-to-span mode where rectangular gap-filling is needed.

## [1.15.4] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Overlapping zone multi-zone cascade**: Placing cursor on a zone fully inside a larger zone no longer highlights all zones. Fixed detectMultiZone to separate overlapping zones (cursor inside) from edge-adjacent zones (cursor near edge). Only edge-adjacent zones trigger multi-zone snap. Replaced bounding-rect expansion with edge-adjacency flood-fill that skips zones spatially overlapping the seed. Removed duplicated smallest-area loop in paint-to-span.
- **Edge tolerance now respects settings**: Zone-to-zone edge detection uses the user's adjacentThreshold setting instead of a hardcoded 5px value, so manually-gapped layouts work correctly with the configured proximity.

## [1.15.3] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **KWin effect plugin version lock**: Effect plugin embeds EffectPluginFactory version in its IID. It only loads when runtime KWin matches. Added build-time version visibility in CMake and RPM spec now requires exact KWin version match, preventing 6.6.0-built plugins from installing on 6.6.1 systems where they fail to load.

## [1.15.2] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Overlapping zone snapping**: When zones overlap, the smallest zone at the cursor position is now selected instead of the first in list order. Matches FancyZones' area-covered heuristic so the more specific zone wins.

## [1.15.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **RPM packaging**: Added KCM and editor translation files (`kcm_plasmazones.mo`, `plasmazones-editor.mo`) to spec `%files` section, fixing "unpackaged file(s) found" build failure on Fedora.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Mosaic Pulse shader**: Audio-reactive stained glass mosaic with colorful tiles, pulsing shapes (circles, diamonds, squares), sparkles, and dithered posterization. Bass drives shape pulse, mids shift hue, treble triggers sparkles. 12 configurable parameters across 6 groups.
- **User-supplied image textures**: Shader effects can now sample up to 4 user-provided images (bindings 7-10) with configurable wrap modes.
- **Shared GLSL utilities**: Extracted `common.glsl`, `audio.glsl`, `textures.glsl`, and `multipass.glsl` as shared includes. All shaders updated to use common helpers (hash, noise, SDF, blending, audio bands).

### Fixed
- **System layout restore**: Deleting a user layout override from KCM now correctly restores the system-provided layout instead of leaving a blank state.
- **System layout label**: Label now includes "zones" suffix for consistency with other layout names.
- **Translation extraction**: 33 missing source files added to the extraction list so all translatable strings are captured.
- **German .po headers**: Normalized header fields for consistency across all 3 translation domains.

### Changed
- **German translations**: Complete coverage for all 3 domains (daemon, KCM, effect). Removed 49 obsolete entries.
- Removed outdated shader presets.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Zone persistence on daemon restart**: Windows that were snapped to zones are now correctly re-registered when the daemon is stopped and started. Root cause: `pendingRestoresAvailable` was never emitted because the layout was set before the WindowTrackingAdaptor connected to `activeLayoutChanged`. Now sets `m_hasPendingRestores` at init when pending assignments are loaded. Also saves window tracking state on daemon shutdown so snapped windows persist across restarts.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Per-side edge gaps**: Independent top/bottom/left/right outer gap values instead of a single uniform gap, useful for transparent panels or asymmetric screen setups. Global toggle in KCM with per-layout overrides in the editor. Full undo/redo support. ([#187], [#188])
- **Per-zone fixed pixel geometry**: Zones can now use absolute pixel coordinates instead of relative 0.0-1.0 values, enabling precise pixel-perfect layouts that don't scale with resolution. Per-zone toggle between Relative and Fixed modes in the editor. ([#180], [#182])
- **Full screen geometry toggle**: Per-layout option to use the full screen area (ignoring panels/taskbars) for zone calculations, allowing zones to extend behind auto-hide or transparent panels. ([#179], [#181])
- **AlwaysActive zone activation**: New activation mode that shows zones on every window drag without requiring a modifier key or mouse button. Configurable in KCM Zones tab. ([#185], [#186])

### Changed
- **Copy-on-write layout saving**: Layouts are only written to disk when actually modified, with per-layout dirty tracking to avoid unnecessary I/O during bulk operations.

### Fixed
- Hardcoded 1920x1080 fallback removed from D-Bus zone detection. Uses actual screen geometry.
- Fixed preview rendering for fixed-geometry zones in KCM new layout dialog.
- All layouts recalculated on startup and screen changes to prevent stale geometry.
- Per-side edge gap: -1 sentinel no longer leaks into geometry calculations when settings are unavailable.
- Per-side edge gap: `usePerSideOuterGap` toggle now persists across save/load even with all-default side values.
- Per-side edge gap: clearing override in editor is now undoable.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Layout Picker Overlay**: Full-screen interactive layout browser triggered via configurable keyboard shortcut. Browse all available layouts in a centered card grid with keyboard navigation (arrow keys + Enter) and mouse support. Selecting a layout switches to it and resnaps all windows. ([#176])
- **Shared LayoutCard component**: Extracted reusable `LayoutCard.qml` and `PopupFrame.qml` into `org.plasmazones.common` QML module, shared between the Zone Selector and Layout Picker overlays.
- **Snap Assist after resnap**: Snap Assist now triggers after resnapping windows when switching layouts via the layout picker, offering to fill any empty zones.

### Fixed
- **Zone activation broken when Zone Selector disabled** ([#175]): Disabling the Zone Selector popup caused the zone activation hotkey (e.g. Alt+drag) to stop working entirely. The root cause was that D-Bus deserialization of trigger settings could silently fail (Qt delivering `QDBusArgument` instead of native `QVariantList<QVariantMap>`), but this was masked when `zoneSelectorEnabled=true` because a bypass gate let all drag events through regardless. Added robust `QDBusArgument` unwrapping, a permissive `m_triggersLoaded` flag that allows drags through until triggers are confirmed loaded, and diagnostic logging for trigger load failures.
- **Layout Picker double-trigger**: Rapidly pressing the layout picker shortcut could create multiple overlay windows with competing `KeyboardInteractivityExclusive` keyboard grabs on Wayland, causing shortcuts to stop working. Replaced toggle guard with a simple existence guard that prevents re-triggering while any picker window exists.

## [1.12.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Audio visualizer**: CAVA process silently failed when bar count was odd (exit code 1, "must have even number of bars with stereo output"). Even bar counts are now enforced at all layers: CavaService, KCM setter, and UI slider (stepSize=2).
- **Audio shader data**: QML `|| []` fallback on `audioSpectrum` binding forced V4 JavaScript conversion, losing the native `QVector<float>` type needed by `ZoneShaderItem`'s fast path. Replaced with a `Binding` element guarded by `when` to preserve type identity through the binding chain.
- **CAVA stderr capture**: Switched from `ForwardedErrorChannel` to `SeparateChannels` so CAVA error output is captured in daemon logs instead of lost.
- **CAVA exit diagnostics**: Moved `exitCode()`/`readAllStandardError()` from `stateChanged` to `finished` signal handler per Qt API contract. Only warns on non-zero exit code (stderr on exit 0 is normal for CAVA).

### Changed
- **Shared audio constants**: `Audio::MinBars`/`Audio::MaxBars` moved to `src/core/constants.h` with `static_assert` for even values, eliminating magic number duplication across CavaService, KCM, and QML.
- **Nix**: Re-enabled Nix CI, release builds, flake.lock updater, and `plasmazones.nix` release asset now that nixpkgs-unstable has the Plasma 6.6 stack (NixOS/nixpkgs#479797).

## [1.12.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **KCM Editor tab**: Use unique QML type `PlasmaZonesKeySequenceInput` so the Editor tab always loads the bundled shortcut component (with `defaultKeySequence`). Fixes "Type EditorTab unavailable" / "Cannot assign to non-existent property 'defaultKeySequence'" when the KCM runs from system install (e.g. NixOS) where another `KeySequenceInput` could be resolved first.
- **KWin effect**: Remove explicit `Id` from plugin metadata so the loader uses the filename-derived id and the kf.coreaddons warning is resolved.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Reapply window geometries after geometry updates**: When zones or panel geometry change (e.g. after closing the KDE panel editor), the daemon requests the KWin effect to reapply snapped window positions so windows stay correctly placed in zones.
- **D-Bus**: `reapplyWindowGeometriesRequested` signal and `getUpdatedWindowGeometries` method on WindowTracking for the effect to fetch and apply geometries.
- **ScreenManager**: `delayedPanelRequeryCompleted` signal when the delayed panel requery finishes (used for documentation, and the reapply path is unified).

### Fixed
- **Panel editor / geometry**: Zones and snapped windows no longer shift incorrectly after editing the KDE panel and closing the panel editor. Geometry debounce (400ms), delayed panel requery (400ms), and immediate reapply (0ms) after each geometry batch keep overlay and window positions correct.
- **Multiple windows in same zone**: Reapply now updates every snapped window. Previously only one window per zone (same app) was updated due to stableId-only lookup. Effect now maps by full window ID with stableId fallback.
- **Effect reapply safety**: Reapply-in-progress guard prevents overlapping async reapply runs. QPointer in async callback avoids use-after-free if the effect is unloaded during reapply.
- **Effect JSON**: Robust validation and skip of invalid geometry entries. QLatin1String for JSON keys (Qt6). Single-pass window map.

### Changed
- **Reapply timing**: Reapply runs after every geometry batch (0ms delay). Removed redundant 1100ms/450ms reapply path. Delayed panel requery still triggers the same debounce → processPendingGeometryUpdates → reapply flow.
- **Daemon**: Reapply timer stopped in `stop()`. Named constants for geometry and panel delays.
- **Nix**: Build asserts layer-shell QPA plugin compatibility and fails with a clear message when nixpkgs provides the 6.5 stack. Nix CI and release Nix build/artifact disabled until nixpkgs has Plasma 6.6.

## [1.11.8] - 2026-02-16

### Performance
- **Signal-driven drag detection**: Replaced the QTimer-based poll loop (32ms stacking-order scans during drag) with KWin's per-window `windowStartUserMovedResized` / `windowFinishUserMovedResized` signals for zero-cost, event-driven drag start/end detection. Eliminates the `m_pollTimer` entirely, with no more periodic stacking-order iteration on the compositor thread, even as a safety net ([#167])

## [1.11.7] - 2026-02-16

### Performance
- **Event-driven cursor tracking**: Cursor position updates during drag are now driven by `slotMouseChanged` instead of the poll timer, eliminating QTimer jitter from the compositor frame path and providing more accurate cursor tracking at input-device cadence
- **Throttled dragMoved signals**: `DragTracker::updateCursorPosition()` throttles `dragMoved` emissions to ~30Hz via `QElapsedTimer`, preventing D-Bus flooding from high-frequency (1000Hz) mouse input
- **Eliminated QDBusInterface for WindowDrag**: Replaced `QDBusInterface` with `QDBusMessage::createMethodCall` for all WindowDrag D-Bus calls (`dragStarted`, `dragMoved`, `dragStopped`, `cancelSnap`), avoiding synchronous D-Bus introspection that could block the compositor thread with a ~25s timeout if the daemon is registered but slow to respond
- **Pre-parsed activation triggers**: Activation triggers are now parsed from `QVariantList` to POD structs (`ParsedTrigger`) once at load time, removing per-call `QVariant` unboxing overhead from `anyLocalTriggerHeld()` (~30 calls/sec during drag)

## [1.11.6] - 2026-02-16

### Performance
- **Dynamic poll timer**: Poll rate switches from 500ms (idle) to 32ms (~30Hz) only when LMB is pressed, eliminating continuous 60Hz stacking-order scans on the compositor thread when no drag is active ([#167])
- **Early-exit idle polls**: `DragTracker::pollWindowMoves()` skips the full stacking-order iteration when no drag is active and no button is held
- **Reduced D-Bus traffic during drag**: Active-drag poll rate lowered from 16ms (60Hz) to 32ms (30Hz) because zone detection doesn't need sub-33ms updates, and halving D-Bus message serialization on the compositor thread reduces frame-time jitter on high-refresh-rate displays ([#167])
- **Guard redundant daemon work**: `hideOverlayAndClearZoneState()` now short-circuits when overlay is already hidden and zone state is clear, preventing 30Hz `clearHighlights()`/`clearHighlight()` calls that could congest the daemon event loop and create D-Bus back-pressure ([#167])

## [1.11.5] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- **KCM tab buttons**: Prevent tab buttons from resizing when switching tabs

### Performance
- **Deferred D-Bus calls during drag**: Keyboard grab and D-Bus `dragStarted`/`dragMoved` calls are now deferred until an activation trigger is actually detected, eliminating 60Hz D-Bus traffic and keyboard grab/ungrab overhead for non-zone window drags ([#167])
- **Deduplicated trigger read**: `WindowDragAdaptor::dragMoved()` now reads activation triggers once per call instead of twice

## [1.11.4] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- **Layout grid cards**: Badge and zone count text were left-aligned instead of centered under each card

## [1.11.3] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Master toggle for zone span**: New checkbox to fully enable/disable paint-to-span zone selection. Defaults to on. When off, modifier and threshold controls are greyed out.
- **Master toggle for snap assist**: New checkbox to fully enable/disable the snap assist (window picker) feature. Defaults to on. When off, all snap assist sub-options are greyed out.

### Fixed
- **Nix flake evaluation error**: `lib.mkPackageOption` received a derivation instead of an attribute path, causing evaluation failures when `package` was not explicitly specified. Users can now use `programs.plasmazones.enable = true` without setting `package`.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Snap Assist trigger override** ([#166]): When "Always show" is off, hold a configurable modifier or mouse button when releasing a window to enable Snap Assist for that snap only. Uses the same multi-trigger widget as zone activation and zone span.

### Changed
- **Snap Assist UI**: "Always show" checkbox. When off, configure hold-to-enable trigger via ModifierAndMouseCheckBoxes (shown disabled when always-on).
- **D-Bus breaking**: `org.plasmazones.WindowDrag.dragStopped` now requires `modifiers` and `mouseButtons` at release (for Snap Assist triggers). KWin effect and daemon must be from the same PlasmaZones version.

### Fixed
- **KCM UX consistency**: Section titles added for all groups in Zones tab cards: Appearance (Colors, Border), Effects (Visual Effects), Activation (Triggers), so every section has a consistent heading

## [1.11.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Drag stutter**: Removed redundant `windowFrameGeometryChanged` handler that flooded D-Bus with 60-144+ calls/sec during window drag, causing visible stutter and leaving the daemon in a stale state ([#167])
- **Login hang**: Replaced synchronous `QDBusInterface` introspection in `loadExclusionSettings()` with async `QDBusMessage` call, preventing the compositor from blocking for up to 25 seconds during login when the daemon is registered but not yet responding ([#167])

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **EDID-based monitor identification**: Monitors are now identified by manufacturer, model, and serial number instead of connector name (e.g. "DP-2"). Layouts stay assigned to the correct physical monitor regardless of which port it's connected to ([#164])
- **Nix flake**: Proper `flake.nix` with NixOS module (`programs.plasmazones.enable`), Home Manager module, overlay, and dev shell
- **Multi-arch Nix CI**: Flake-based CI builds on both x86_64-linux and aarch64-linux with magic-nix-cache
- Weekly `flake.lock` auto-update workflow

### Fixed
- **NixOS KCM loading failure**: KCM QML components failed to load in System Settings on NixOS due to missing `qmldir` files and unresolvable QML runtime dependencies (kirigami, qqc2-desktop-style) ([Discussion #160])
- Zone selector popup layouts are now sorted alphabetically by name
- D-Bus `toggleActivation` method was not registered in the settings adaptor

### Changed
- Nix CI uses `nix build`/`nix flake check` instead of legacy `nix-build --expr`
- Nix install action upgraded from v30 to v31
- Release notes now include flake-based NixOS installation instructions alongside standalone `plasmazones.nix`

## [1.10.6] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Toggle activation mode**: Zone activation modifier can be toggled on/off with a single press instead of requiring hold. Useful for trackpad and accessibility users ([#159])

### Changed
- **Proximity snap always active**: Removed the multi-zone modifier setting entirely. Adjacent zone detection now always works during drag with no modifier required
- **Zone span default changed to Ctrl**: Paint-to-span modifier defaults to Ctrl instead of Meta, avoiding conflict with KDE's Meta shortcut in toggle activation mode
- CI: Replaced DeterminateSystems/FlakeHub Nix actions with cachix/install-nix-action

### Fixed
- Nix build: ECM's KDEInstallDirs resolved an absolute systemd unit path outside the Nix store, causing postInstall to fail ([#159])

## [1.10.5] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Snap Assist D-Bus calls made fully async to prevent compositor freeze when daemon is busy with overlay teardown ([#158])
- Zone selector snapping now uses the same geometry pipeline as overlay snapping, so gap handling is consistent

## [1.10.4] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Session restore places windows on wrong display in multi-monitor setups. Active screen and desktop assignments were lost on daemon restart ([#156])
- Escape during drag now dismisses overlay without cancelling the drag. Re-pressing the activation trigger re-shows the overlay
- Keyboard grab released in effect destructor to prevent input loss if effect unloads mid-drag

## [1.10.3] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- CAVA audio visualizer not starting without daemon restart after enabling in KCM ([#150])
- Shader effects toggle, frame rate, and spectrum bar count changes also required restart, from the same root cause
- No default layout selected on fresh install. Columns (2) now gets the star badge out of the box
- `defaults()` uses `defaultOrder` from layout metadata instead of hardcoded name match

## [1.10.2] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Release workflow: delete pre-existing GitHub release before recreating with build assets (fixes HTTP 422 on asset upload)
- RPM spec and Debian changelog no longer manually maintained. CI generates both from CHANGELOG.md via `generate-changelog.sh`
- RPM spec Version field uses `0.0.0` placeholder (CI replaces from git tag)
- Avoid literal `%changelog` in spec header comments (broke `sed` in changelog generator)

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Multiple binds per action**: Configure up to 4 independent triggers for zone activation, proximity snap, and paint-to-span, e.g. Alt key + Right mouse button as separate triggers for different input devices ([#150])
- Click-to-edit existing triggers in the KCM. Click a trigger label to replace it in-place
- AND semantics for combined modifier+button triggers (both must be held)
- Conflict detection warns when the same trigger is used across multiple actions

### Fixed
- Multi-zone threshold setting not applied correctly ([#147])
- Modifier shortcuts now exclude the activation key to prevent conflicts
- Legacy config keys cleaned up on save (stale DragActivationModifier, mouse button keys removed)
- Empty trigger list prevented. At least one trigger is always required per action

### Changed
- Settings stored as JSON trigger lists (automatic migration from single-value format)
- KWin effect simplified. The daemon handles all trigger matching via `anyTriggerHeld()`
- D-Bus API: new `dragActivationTriggers`, `multiZoneTriggers`, `zoneSpanTriggers` list properties replace individual modifier/mouse button getters

## [1.9.5] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Zones can overlap Plasma panels set to autohide/dodge windows ([#148])
- Force-end drag on mouse button release for safer drag lifecycle
- Proximity snap always active by default (no modifier required)

### Fixed
- **Compositor freeze**: Remove `processEvents()` calls that deadlock with Wayland compositor during drag ([#152])
- **Compositor stall on layout change**: Hide overlay/zone selector before layout switch in zone selector drop path, skip heavy QML updates for hidden windows
- **Snap assist Escape not working**: Keep KGlobalAccel Escape shortcut registered through snap assist phase. Add `snapAssistDismissed` signal for proper cleanup
- **Snap assist not dismissing**: Dismiss snap assist on any window zone change (navigation, snap, unsnap, float toggle)
- **Snap assist wrong window**: Use full windowId (not stableId) for per-instance floating/geometry tracking
- Snap assist Escape handling, dismiss on new drag, zone selector layout sync
- Paint-to-snap raycasting and shader highlight for multi-zone selection
- Mouse-button zone activation now latches until drag ends (no flicker)
- Shortcut clear button resets to default instead of empty
- Inverted panel-hiding check for usable geometry
- KCM linker errors from missing kcfg sources

### Changed
- Remove 66 dead code items across 48 files
- Remove dead multiZoneEnabled code

## [1.9.3] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- Proximity snap "always on" no longer bypasses overlay activation. It now only enables proximity snap when the overlay is already open via the activation key

## [1.9.2] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- KCM: "Proximity snap always on" checkbox enables always-on proximity snap without holding the modifier (per [#143])
- Escape key cancels overlay during window drag. Overlay stays hidden until the next drag of a stationary window

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Snap Assist: Aero Snap style window picker after snapping, allowing users to fill empty zones with unsnapped windows ([#95])
- Snap Assist overlay with window thumbnails, zone-mapped layout, and KCM setting to enable/disable
- `getEmptyZonesJson` and `showSnapAssist` D-Bus APIs for Snap Assist integration

### Fixed
- Zone padding and outer gap in individual layout settings now persist correctly when saving ([#145])
- Default layouts no longer include redundant zone padding override (use global setting by default)
- Snap Assist: overlay zone appearance matches zone colors and borders. Thumbnail caching across continuation
- Snap Assist: KWin effect default for snapAssistEnabled until D-Bus loaded (avoids race)

### Changed
- Packaging: add env.d to RPM %files. Remove redundant Snap Assist message from Arch install

## [1.8.4] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Shader preset load/save in editor ShaderSettingsDialog
- Preview shader effects in zone editor ([#132])
- Restore window size immediately when dragging between zones ([#133])

### Fixed

- Hide shader preview overlay when dialogs open or app loses focus
- PR review feedback for shader preview

### Removed
- Dead `zoneGeometryDuringDrag` slot

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-09

### Added

### Changed
- Rename `NumberColor` setting to `LabelFontColor` for consistent `LabelFont*` naming across all layers ([#97])
- Sort layouts alphabetically by name in KCM
- Use generic `adjustlevels` icon for shader settings button in editor (replaces app-specific icon)

### Fixed
- Self-referencing `font.family` QML binding preventing font reset from updating previews ([#97])
- Font reset button now also resets label size scale
- `qFuzzyCompare` edge case in KCM font scale setter (clamp before compare)
- Remove dead `labelFontColor` property from zone selector window
- Auto badge distinguished from Manual badge using `activeTextColor`

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- Paint-to-span zone modifier: hold a modifier while dragging to progressively paint across zones, window snaps to bounding rectangle on release ([#94], [#96])
- Configurable "Paint-to-span modifier" in KCM Zones tab (default Alt+Meta)
- Renamed "Multi-zone modifier" to "Proximity snap modifier" for clarity

### Changed
- Replaced `middleClickMultiZone` bool setting with `zoneSpanModifier` DragModifier enum
- Config migration: users who had middle-click multi-zone disabled keep zone span disabled after upgrade
- Extracted `prepareHandlerContext()`, `computeCombinedZoneGeometry()`, and `zoneIdsToStringList()` helpers in drag handling (DRY)
- Added `setOsdStyleInt` range validation

### Removed
- Dead `skipSnapModifier` setting (fully scaffolded but never consumed in drag handling)

### Fixed
- Missing `restoreWindowsToZonesOnLoginChanged` signal in KCM defaults and settings sync
- 12 missing signal emissions in KCM `onSettingsChanged()`
- Painted zone state not cleared on `dragStarted()` causing stale highlights
- Modifier conflict warning using `static bool` instead of per-instance member

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- CAVA audio visualization service for audio-reactive shaders ([#92])

- Editor: defer window destroy during mid-session screen switch
- Unfloat: fall back when saved pre-float screen no longer exists
- Remove misleading shortcut hint from zone overlay
- WrapVulkanHeaders noise in feature summary. ColorUtils.js QML warning

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Layout visibility filtering: control which layouts appear in zone selector per screen, virtual desktop, and activity
  - Tier 1 (KCM): eye toggle to globally hide a layout from the zone selector
  - Tier 2 (Editor): visibility popup to restrict layouts to specific screens, desktops, or activities
  - Empty allow-lists = visible everywhere (opt-in model)
  - Active layout always bypasses filters to prevent empty selector state
  - Undo/redo support for visibility changes in the editor
  - Filter badge on KCM layout cards when Tier 2 restrictions are active
- Layout cycling (`Meta+[/]`) now respects per-screen visibility filtering

### Changed
- OSD style defaults to visual preview instead of text for new installs

### Fixed
- Duplicated and imported layouts no longer inherit visibility restrictions from the source
- Stale screen names auto-cleaned from layout restrictions when monitors are disconnected
- Layout cycling skips hidden/restricted layouts correctly in all directions

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- Editor not moving to selected screen when switching monitors in TopBar or via D-Bus `openEditorForScreen`
- Editor defaulting to wrong screen on Wayland (now uses cursor screen instead of unreliable `primaryScreen`)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Liquid Metal shader: mercury-like fluid surface with environment reflections, Fresnel, bloom, and mouse interaction

### Fixed
- AUR `-bin` package build failure due to `.INSTALL` dotfile left in package root
- Liquid Metal: surface drifting to bottom-left (use standing waves instead of travelling)
- Liquid Metal: inverted mouse Y coordinate
- Liquid Metal: outer glow rendering outside zones due to zoneParams swizzle bug

### Added
- Multi-zone snapping support in window tracking

### Fixed
- Shader parameters from previously-used shaders accumulating in layout JSON
